The protesters gathered in front of the building of the Diyarbak\u0131r branch of the Democratic Society Party (Demokratik Toplum Partisi) (DTP) where a press statement was read out. They then marched. The applicant, as a member of the DTP, participated in the gathering and the ensuing march. According to a police report dated 9 October 2007, the applicant was seen while carrying a banner which read \"\u0130nsanl\u0131k zehirleniyor\" (\"The humanity is being poisoned\") and applauding together with other demonstrators in the police video footage. 7.

On 3 June 2007 local elections were to be held in Moldova, including in Corjova. The applicant, who is an ambulance driver, submitted his candidature for the position of Mayor of Corjova. 7.  On 1 June 2007, at 11 p.m., the applicant's ambulance was stopped by the \"MRT\" road militia and his documents (Moldovan national identity card and driving licence) were taken away from him without any explanation. 8.  On 2 June 2007 the applicant went to the \"MRT\" militia station located in Dub\u0103sari and asked for the return of his documents. He was then arrested and placed in a detention cell. A few hours later a person came to his cell and, without presenting himself, asked him about his work and his electoral propaganda. The applicant later found out that the visitor had been a judge and that, following that discussion in the cell, the judge adopted a decision, finding him guilty of the administrative offence of unlawful electoral propaganda and sentencing him to 15 days' administrative detention. 9.  The applicant submits that he was not allowed to contact his relatives or to find a lawyer, and was not issued with a copy of the court's decision, which prevented any possibility of lodging an effective appeal against the decision of 2 June 2007. 10.  During his detention the applicant was placed in a cell which, according to him was damp and cold. Food was given once a day. When the applicant's relatives, alerted by his absence, contacted the local authorities in order to find out about his fate, they were informed of the applicant's detention. However, their requests to transmit food to him were allegedly rejected. 11.  On 17 June 2007 the applicant was released from detention and he was issued with a copy of the decision of 2 June 2007. The time-limit for lodging an appeal had already expired by that time. Upon release, he was allegedly coughing and was diagnosed with chronic acute bronchitis. He also claims that his eyesight worsened considerably. 12.  In the meantime, on 6 June 2007, the applicant complained to the Moldovan prosecutor's office of his unlawful detention. Based on this complaint, a criminal investigation was initiated on 12 June 2007, the applicant and witnesses were subsequently heard. Three high-ranking \"MRT\" officers were charged and were declared wanted persons.

The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Orhei. 5.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 6.  On 16 January 1997 the Orhei mayor's office attested the property right of a number of private individuals over plots of land in the town. Based on that decision, on 3 April 1997 the same office issued the applicant's brother (C.) title to 0.0569 hectares of land. 7.  On 13 July 1998 C. died. After his death the applicant took possession of the land and used continuously for her own needs. 8.  On 10 September 1999 the territorial cadastre office registered the plot of land as belonging to C. 9.  On 31 January 2000 the Orhei mayor's office amended the annex to its decision of 16 January 1997. C. continued to be mentioned as the owner of the relevant plot of land. 10.  On 15 July 2005 the Orhei mayor's office lodged a civil court action aimed at annulling the property right of C. and the applicant to the relevant land. It claimed that the title had been issued in error since C. had moved to an apartment provided by the town and was no longer eligible to obtain such land. Following this relocation, the cadastre office was supposed to remove C.'s title from the list, which it had failed to do. In the meantime, on an unspecified date the applicant initiated a court action aimed at extending the time-limit for accepting her brother's inheritance. The two court actions were joined by the court on 6 November 2006. 11.  On 15 February 2017 the Orhei district court rejected the court action lodged by the mayor's office and accepted that of the applicant. It noted, inter alia, that the applicant had raised the issue of expiry of the three-year limitation period and added that under Article 78 of the old Civil Code (see paragraph 15 below), the court had to apply the rules concerning the limitation period regardless of the parties' arguments. It found that the mayor's office had missed the three-year limitation period. However, in the operative part the court omitted to refer to the expiry of the limitation period and found that the court action had been groundless. The court also accepted the applicant's action, extending the time-limit for accepting her brother's inheritance since she had taken possession of the relevant land immediately after his death. 12.  On 4 October 2007 the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Court of Appeal overturned that judgment, accepting the appeal lodged by the mayor's office. It annulled C.'s title to the relevant land, finding that he had obtained it in error and that under the applicable law he could not be the owner of that land. Moreover, the court rejected the applicant's claim for extending the time-limit for accepting her brother's inheritance, finding that she had missed it without a valid reason. 13.  On 12 March 2008 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the judgment of the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Court of Appeal. 14.  The applicant submitted documents showing that she had paid various taxes for the land in question over the years. 15.

The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Adana. 6.  On 16 February 2006 a gathering was held in Adana on the anniversary of the arrest of Abdullah \u00d6calan, the leader of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party), an illegal armed organisation. The protesters gathered in front of the building of the Adana branch of the Democratic Society Party (Demokratik Toplum Partisi) (DTP), where a press statement was read out. Being a member of the DTP, the applicant participated in the gathering. 7.  Subsequently, clashes occurred between police officers and some demonstrators who were attempting to block the traffic. According to police reports, two police officers were injured as a result of objects thrown from the DTP building. The police then entered the DTP building and arrested 223 people, including the applicant. The next day, the applicant was detained on remand. 8.  On 10 March 2006 the Adana public prosecutor charged the applicant and sixteen other people with membership of the PKK under Articles 220 \u00a7 6 and 314 of the Criminal Code. The prosecutor alleged that the accused had participated in the public gathering in question in response to calls made by the PKK and had resisted the police officers, and that they had therefore acted on behalf of the PKK. 9.  On 5 May 2006 the applicant was released pending trial. 10.  On 10 September 2008 the Adana Assize Court convicted the applicant under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713). The assize court did not find it established that the applicant had attended the reading out of the press statement in response to calls made by the PKK or that she had injured any police officers. It therefore concluded that the applicant could not be convicted of membership of the PKK or resistance to the police. The court nonetheless considered that on 16 February 2006 the applicant had gone to the DTP building with a view to disseminating propaganda in support of the PKK and that she should therefore be convicted under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713. The applicant was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment. 11.  Taking into account the applicant's good behaviour during the trial and the absence of any previous criminal record, the court suspended the pronouncement of her conviction on condition that she did not commit another intentional offence for a period of five years, under Article 231 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (h\u00fckm\u00fcn a\u00e7\u0131klanmas\u0131n\u0131n geri b\u0131rak\u0131lmas\u0131). 12.

The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Varna. 6.  The applicant and his wife divorced on 21 August 2006 pursuant to a court-approved agreement between the two of them. Under the terms of this agreement, the applicant undertook to pay child support to the two children born during the marriage and agreed to his wife's keeping his family name after the divorce. 7.  Subsequently, the applicant learned that his former wife had conceived their second child, born in 2003, as a result of a relationship with another man during her marriage to the applicant. The applicant underwent a DNA test to determine whether he was the father of the younger child. The DNA test \u2012 the result of which the applicant received on 15 January 2007 \u2012 established that he was not the biological father of the second child. The results of this DNA test were never considered by a court. 8.  Shortly thereafter, in February 2007, the applicant brought a civil claim in court, seeking to contest his paternity of the child in question. On 1 March 2007 the Varna Regional Court dismissed his request, finding that it was time-barred due to the expiry \u2013 in 2004 \u2013 of the year-long limitation period counting from the child's birth or from learning thereof (see the section \"Relevant domestic law and practice\" below\"). This finding was confirmed by two higher judicial instances, the final decision being pronounced by the Supreme Court of Cassation on 19 September 2007. 9.  The applicant brought subsequent proceedings in which he sought to stop paying child support to the second child. On 20 May 2008 his claim was rejected by the Varna District Court, which found that it had not been proven that the applicant was not the child's father, given that he had not rebutted the legal presumption under Article 32 (1) of the Family Code 1985 (\"the 1985 Code\").

The applicant was born in 1971 and at the time of introduction of the application to the Court he was detained in Diavata Prison. 6.  The applicant is serving a life sentence for drug dealing. He was initially placed in Diavata Prison from 1 October 2014 until 24 November 2015. On that date he was transferred to Malandrino Prison, from where he was transferred back to Diavata Prison on 9 May 2016. Lastly, on 20 December 2016 he was transferred back to Malandrino Prison. 7.  The applicant alleged that he had been detained initially in cell no. B 14, which had measured 9 sq. m and had held four detainees in total. On 7 August 2016 he had been placed in cell no. GR 2 on the ground floor, which had measured 24 sq. m and had held ten detainees. In both cases, therefore, the living space afforded to him had been less than 3 sq. m. Overcrowding had exposed him to infectious diseases and he had suffered from passive smoking. In addition, detainees had had barely any space to move within their cell and their bunk beds had been low, not allowing them to sit up comfortably. 8.  Apart from the overcrowding, the applicant submitted that the conditions of his detention had been very poor. Access to natural light and ventilation had been inadequate. Sanitary facilities and supplies had been old, broken and insufficient to ensure the detainees' well\u2011being and personal hygiene. Heating had been provided only for one hour per day from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., while hot water during winter had been provided for two hours per day and had not sufficed for all detainees. They had been forced to wash themselves using buckets of water, as the water pressure in showers had been insufficient. In each ten-person cell there had been five bunk beds, five stools, a small table and five side tables but no lockable space for personal belongings. In the four-person cell there had been two bunk beds and two stools. The mattresses had been old, mouldy and smelly, and sheets and towels had not been provided. 9.  In general, detainees had lacked access to cultural, recreational and sports activities. They had had to rely on visits from friends and family in order to obtain any newspapers or magazines, which had intensified their feeling of isolation. The hours that they had been allowed to spend in the corridors had been insufficient, taking into account that they had coincided with the meal times as well as with the times they had been allowed to receive visits or make phone calls. The yard had included a football field but no balls had been provided to the detainees and the yard had not offered any opportunities for spending time creatively. The applicant further complained of the quantity and the quality of the food, claiming that it had been repetitive and lacking any nutritional value. 10.  Lastly, the applicant submitted that the conditions of his detention had led him having several cardiac arrests. 11.  The Government, referring to a document provided by the prison authorities, submitted that Diavata Prison had a capacity of 358 detainees on the basis of allocation of 4 sq. m per detainee according to the minimum standards set by the CPT. At the time the applicant had been detained, the prison facility had exceeded its capacity by accommodating 460 to 500 detainees. The applicant had been detained in cell no. 11 on the first floor, which had measured 24 sq. m, including a toilet measuring 2 sq. m. The cell had had a capacity of ten detainees; however, following a new law in April 2015 aimed at relieving overcrowding in prisons, many detainees had been released and that had resulted in the applicant sharing the cell with four to six detainees. Therefore, the living space afforded to the applicant had ranged from 3.14 to 4.4 sq. m. 12.  As regards the rest of the applicant's complaints, the Government argued that the prison had had a central heating system, in addition to the electric heating devices that had been provided to each cell. The cell in which the applicant had been detained had had large windows. Detainees had had access to hot water and had been provided regularly with personal hygiene products. The cells had been regularly disinfected. As regards prisoners' meals, the Government submitted the menu of various random weeks to demonstrate that they had been comprised of a variety of food. 13.  The Government submitted the applicant's medical file in order to prove that the applicant had already suffered from cardiac conditions when his incarceration had started. The applicant's medical needs had been fully fulfilled during the time he had spent in Diavata Prison either by visits to the prison doctor or by his transfer to nearby hospitals. Lastly, the applicant had been granted fifteen days of leave in order to take matriculation exams.

The applicant was born in 1978. According to the most recently available information, at the time of the events in June 2016 the applicant was detained in Kirovograd pre-trial detention facility no. 14 (\"the SIZO\"). 5.  In January 2013 the applicant started serving a sentence of ten years' imprisonment for murder. In February 2013 he was placed in Kirovograd prison no. 6 (\"the Prison\"). 6.  In April 2014 the applicant's health deteriorated. He complained of fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. Following his examination in Kirovograd Regional Hospital, the applicant was diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis (calculi within the gallbladder) and acute chronic gastroduodenitis. 7.  On 11 April 2014 the applicant complained of feeling unwell to the Prison medical unit. He was examined immediately and diagnosed with acute gastroduodenitis and chronic calculous cholecystitis. According to the case-file material, he was not prescribed medical treatment. 8.  On 22 August 2014 the applicant further complained to the Prison medical unit of feeling unwell. He was diagnosed with acute chronic gastroduodenitis and was prescribed dietary treatment for three days. 9.  On 6, 8 and 13 October and 5 November 2014, and 6 March 2015, in response to further complaints by the applicant, he was prescribed outpatient treatment. According to the Government, the outpatient treatment consisted of medicine, which was administered to the applicant in various combinations, notably, papaverine, co-trimixazole, azithromycin, and bromhexin. 10.  Following another such complaint, on 16 April 2015 the Prison doctor diagnosed the applicant with acute chronic gastroduodenitis and recommended that he be further examined at a specialist institution with a view to deciding whether he required surgery. 11.  From 2 to 29 May and from 3 to 11 June 2015 the applicant underwent inpatient treatment for acute chronic gastroduodenitis in the Prison medical unit. According to the Government, he was administered the prescribed medication and his state of health improved. 12.  On 10 July 2015 he was examined by a general practitioner of Kirovograd City Hospital, who confirmed the earlier diagnoses and recommended inpatient treatment and dietary treatment. 13.  From 28 July to 10 September 2015 the applicant underwent inpatient treatment for calculus cholecystitis in unstable remission at the hospital in Bucha prison no. 85. The applicant alleged that the treatment which he had received there had been inadequate and had led to an aggravation of his condition. He also alleged that surgery for his calculus cholecystitis had been scheduled but had not been performed owing to lack of funds. 14.  On 21 September 2015 he was transferred back to the Prison. In the meantime he had been detained in the Kyiv SIZO and the Odessa SIZO. During his detention from 14 to 21 September 2015, he complained to the SIZOs' administration of abdominal pain and vomiting, but allegedly to no avail. 15.  On 8 October 2015 the applicant was placed in a disciplinary cell in the Prison for three months as a penalty for consumption of alcohol. According to the applicant, the conditions of his detention there were very poor: he suffered from lack of fresh air, low temperatures, unsanitary conditions and high humidity. Furthermore, he allegedly had no mattress to sleep on. 16.  According to the Government, on 8 October 2015 the Prison governor issued a decision on the applicant' placement in a disciplinary cell for consumption of alcohol. On 30 December 2015 he was early released from the disciplinary cell. 17.  On 12 October 2015 the applicant's lawyer complained to the Kirovograd regional prosecutor's office that the applicant was not receiving the requisite medical care in detention. He submitted, in particular, that the surgery which the applicant required had been postponed owing to the lack of funds. 18.  On 23 October 2015 the Prison doctor examined the applicant once again and diagnosed him with chronic calculous cholecystitis in unstable remission. He prescribed the applicant medication and recommended elective surgery. 19.  On 9 November 2015 the prison service of Kirovograd Region sent a request for the applicant's placement in the hospital in Bucha prison no. 85. On 9 December 2015 this request was refused owing to the lack of available places in the hospital. 20.  On 11 December 2015 and 16 January 2016 the prison service again requested the applicant's placement in the hospital at correctional colony no. 4 of Dnipropetrovsk Region. On 27 January 2016 the prison service took a decision on the applicant's transfer to the hospital for the required surgery. 21.  On 12 February 2016 the applicant informed the Prison governor that he had refused the treatment offered to him in the hospitals within the Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv SIZOs because of lack of trust in the doctors of those facilities. On the same day the applicant gave his consent to receive treatment at any other medical institution. 22.  On 22 April 2016 following deterioration of his health, the applicant was transferred by ambulance to Kirovograd Regional Hospital, where he was examined by a surgeon and diagnosed with calculous cholecystitis, chronic pancreatitis and \"diffusive changes\" of the liver (\u0434\u0438\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0456 \u0437\u043c\u0456\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0456\u043d\u043a\u0438). 23.

The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Ad\u0131yaman. 5.  On 17 October 1999 the applicant sat an examination in order to become a public servant.

On 4 September 2000 the Kilis branch of TEDA\u015e informed the applicant that she would not be appointed to a post in that office as she did not fulfil the requirements of \"being a man\" and \"having completed military service\". 7.  On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an action against TEDA\u015e with the Ankara Administrative Court requesting the annulment of the decision of the Kilis branch of TEDA\u015e. In her deposition, the applicant noted that being a man was not a requirement for appointment to the post in question and that she fulfilled all the requirements for that post. 8.  On an unspecified date the general directorate of TEDA\u015e submitted to the administrative court that one of the requirements for the post in question had been declared by the State Personnel Department as \"having completed military service\" and that therefore only men could be appointed to the post. The applicant, being a woman, could therefore not be recruited as a security officer. 9.  On 28 November 2001 the Ankara Administrative Court annulled the decision of the Kilis branch of TEDA\u015e. The court held that the requirement of \"having completed military service\" should be considered to apply only to male candidates and that there had been no restriction on women working as security officers in TEDA\u015e. 10.  On 30 January 2002 TEDA\u015e lodged an appeal against the judgment of 28 November 2001. 11.  On 1 April 2003 the applicant was recruited by TEDA\u015e. 12.  On 21 October 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court, holding that the requirement regarding military service demonstrated that the post in question was reserved for male candidates. The high court therefore found that the administration's decision had been in accordance with the law. 13.  On 19 March 2004 the applicant was dismissed from her post. 14.  On 30 December 2004 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's case, taking into consideration the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court. 15.  On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the judgment of 30 December 2004. 16.

The applicants were born in 1954, 1952, 1964, 1926, 1952, 1960 and 1956 respectively and live in Donetsk. 6.  From the beginning of April 2014 armed groups started to seize official buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and announced the creation of self-proclaimed entities known as the \"Donetsk People's Republic\" and \"Luhansk People's Republic\" (the \"DPR\" and \"LPR\"). 7.  In response, on 14 April 2014 the Government, who consider the armed groups to be terrorist organisations, authorised the use of force against them in the legal form of an \"anti-terrorist operation\". 8.  In June 2014 the armed groups started to seize offices of the National Bank of Ukraine and other regional financial institutions in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 9.  On 24 July 2014 the Ukrainian postal service Ukrposhta suspended its operations on the territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were outside the control of the Government, because of frequent attacks on its vehicles and employees by armed groups. 10.  On 6 August 2014 the National Bank of Ukraine suspended all financial transactions on the territories outside the control of the Government (see paragraph 20 below). 11.  Government forces recaptured some territories in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but certain parts of the regions have remained outside the Government's control since that time. One part of the Donetsk region not under the Government's control is the city of Donetsk. 12.  On 2 September 2014, following changes in the law, jurisdiction of the courts in the non-controlled areas was transferred to the relevant courts in the neighbouring regions on the territory controlled by the Government (see paragraphs 34 to 36 below). 13.  On 11 November 2014 all social benefit payments in the settlements of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were outside the control of the Government were suspended (see paragraph 26 below) 14.  In December 2014 the Donetsk Regional Administrative Court and the Donetsk Regional Administrative Court of Appeal were relocated to the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, territory controlled by the Government (see paragraphs 37 and 38 below). 15.  The applicants were registered as recipients of social benefits with different departments of the Pension Fund of Ukraine in Donetsk. Some applicants had been receiving their social benefits until 30 June 2014, others until 31 August 2014. 16.  On 16 June 2015 the first and second applicants registered themselves with the Labour and Social Security Department of the Krasnoarmiysk District of the Donetsk region (currently the city of Pokrovsk), controlled by the Government. On the same day their social benefits was reinstated, including social benefits due to them for the period 1 July 2014 to 16 June 2015. 17.  The sixth applicant was registered with the Labour and Social Security Department of the Obolonskiy District in Kyiv on 9 September 2015. However, she did not apply for reinstatement of her social benefits. 18.  The other applicants did not apply to the relevant social authorities on the territory controlled by the Government for reinstatement of their social benefits. 19.  According to the Government, the sixth and seventh applicants travelled from Donetsk to the territory controlled by the Government after their social benefits had been suspended.

The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Ostia Lido. 6.  At birth, the applicant was entered in the civil-status registers as male and was given the forename L. However, the applicant stated that she had always identified as female and lived in society as a woman under the forename S. For instance, her work colleagues (the applicant has worked as a civil servant since 1999) had always called her S., and in the photograph on her identity card issued in August 2000 her appearance was that of a woman. 7.  In 1999 S.V. began treatment with feminising hormones as part of the gender transition process. 8.  On 9 November 2000 she applied to the Rome District Court on the basis of section 3 of Law no. 164 of 1982, stating that she wished to complete the transition process by permanently changing her primary sexual characteristics, and sought authorisation to undergo gender reassignment surgery. 9.  In a judgment of 10 May 2001 the District Court found that the applicant had embarked on the gender transition process after careful consideration. Having taken note of her determination the court authorised her to undergo surgery in order to adapt her primary sexual characteristics to match her female gender identity. 10.  On 30 May 2001 the applicant, while awaiting the surgery authorised by the District Court, applied to the prefect of Rome for a change of forename under Article 89 of Presidential Decree no. 396 of 2000. She argued that, given that she had been undergoing a gender transition process for several years, and in view of her physical appearance, the fact that her identity papers indicated a male forename was a constant source of humiliation and embarrassment. She also asserted that the waiting period for surgery was approximately four years. 11.  In a decision of 4 July 2001 the prefect refused the applicant's request on the grounds that, under Presidential Decree no. 396 of 2000, a person's forename had to correspond to his or her gender. In the prefect's view, in the absence of a final court ruling ordering the change to her legal gender status for the purposes of Law no. 164 of 1982, the applicant's forename could not be changed. 12.  The applicant appealed against that decision to the Lazio Regional Administrative Court and also requested a stay of execution of the prefect's decision. 13.  On 23 July 2001 the applicant underwent mammoplasty. On 6 September 2001 she was placed on a waiting list at Trieste University Hospital for surgery to alter her primary sexual characteristics. 14.  On 21 February 2002 the Regional Administrative Court refused to grant a stay of execution of the prefect's decision. 15.  On 3 February 2003, while the proceedings before the Regional Administrative Court were still pending on the merits, the applicant underwent an operation to change her sexual characteristics from male to female. She subsequently applied to the Rome District Court, on an unspecified date, for legal recognition of her gender reassignment under section 3 of Law no. 164 of 1982. 16.  In a judgment of 10 October 2003 the Rome District Court granted the applicant's request and ordered the Savona municipal authorities to alter the indication of the applicant's gender from male to female and to change the forename L. to S. 17.  By a judgment of 6 March 2008, deposited with the registry on 17 May 2008, the Regional Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the prefect's decision of 4 July 2001. The court held that Article 89 of Presidential Decree no. 396 of 2000 concerning changes of forename was not applicable in the present case, which actually came within the scope of Law no. 164 of 1982 concerning changes to legal gender status. The court stressed in that regard that, under the terms of the latter, the amendment of the civil-status records of a transgender person had to be ordered by the court ruling on his or her gender reassignment. It therefore considered that the prefect had correctly refused the applicant's request.\nThe applicant did not appeal against that judgment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

In 1990 the military prosecutor's offices from several cities opened on their own motion criminal investigations into the use of violence against the demonstrators, which was found excessive.

From March 2017 the military prosecutor examined military and civilian archives, including the vast archives of the Romanian Senate. They also viewed and transcribed more than 400 hours of audio/video recordings. They proceeded with the re-examination of several witnesses. They questioned military personnel involved in the December 1989 military operations and fifty-one members of the political party which ruled at the time and of other authorities. They verified the documents indicating the military units' actions from that period. 10.

The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Moscow. 6.  On 24 January 2011 a bomb attack at the Domodedovo airport killed 37 people and injured more than 160. It was later established that the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber and organised by a militant group operating in the North Caucasus. The applicant, who was present at the airport at the time of explosion, sustained multiple injuries to her body (wounds, contusions and fractures) which provoked further complications (cerebral oedema, coma, respiratory and cardiac insufficiency and a traumatic shock). The applicant's injuries were life-threatening and caused serious harm to her health. 7.  Within the framework of the criminal investigation into the bombing, the investigative authorities arrested four persons. On 11 November 2013 the Moscow Regional Court found them guilty of multiple charges, including commission of an act of terror, organisation of a criminal gang and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Three defendants received life sentence and the fourth one was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. 8.  On 25 November 2014 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the judgment of 11 November 2013 in substance on appeal. 9.  According to the Government, the applicant was granted a victim status. She did not bring a civil action for damages against the convicted persons. 10.  On 25 January 2011 the Russian authorities opened criminal investigation on the charges of negligence against the airport managers and employees and the policemen deployed at the airport. On 22 March 2011 the applicant was granted a victim status in the proceedings. On 5 March 2012 the investigator decided to recall it.

On 27 August 2013 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow dismissed the applicant's claims for damages. On 16 December 2013 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 27 August 2013 on appeal.

The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Istanbul. 6.  On 2 October 2004 the B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00e7ekmece Magistrates' Court issued a search warrant allowing the gendarmerie to conduct searches of public places and suspected persons in a designated area. 7.  Late at night on the same day, the gendarmerie carried out a search at the Sancak Hotel, which is owned by the applicant. The records drawn up afterwards noted that during the course of the search, a certain M.\u015e. had approached the plain-clothes officers outside the hotel and told them that he had a girl inside. It was then established that M.\u015e. trafficked women. He and a woman in the hotel were both taken to the gendarmerie headquarters. 8.  The search records, which were prepared a few hours after the search and signed by the hotel's manager, showed that five women of foreign nationalities had been staying at the hotel with some men and that they had all been taken to the gendarmerie headquarters. 9.  On 3 October 2004 the gendarmerie questioned several men as suspects and five women as victims. They all confirmed that they had been staying at the hotel for prostitution purposes. Some of the women were asked whether they knew of any complicity between the traffickers and the management of Sancak Hotel, to which they responded in the negative. 10.  On the same day the applicant was arrested and taken into the custody of the gendarmerie on suspicion of facilitating prostitution. 11.  On 4 October 2004 the applicant gave statements to the gendarmerie. He denied having provided premises for prostitution. He argued that he did not allow procurers into his hotel and had never seen M.\u015e. before. 12.  On the same day, the gendarmerie also questioned the hotel's manager, who stated that both he and the applicant were very strict about keeping procurers out of their hotel. 13.  On 30 May 2005 the B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00e7ekmece Public Prosecutor issued an indictment against the applicant and three other persons. He accused them of failure to obey an order from an official authority under Article 526 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code (Law no. 765) in force at the time, on the ground that they had provided premises for prostitution in their hotels. 14.  On 1 June 2005 the Misdemeanours Act (Law no. 5326) and the new Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no. 5271) entered into force. 15.  On 10 June 2005 the B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00e7ekmece Magistrates' Court assessed the case without holding a hearing. Establishing that the accused had provided premises for prostitution in their hotels, it held that the applicant had failed to obey the orders of an official authority as charged and should be punished accordingly. It then sentenced him to an administrative fine of 100 Turkish liras (TRY)[1] pursuant to Section 32 of the Misdemeanours Act (Law no. 5326). 16.  The applicant objected to that decision, arguing that his defence rights had been restricted in that the court had sentenced him to the fine solely on the basis of the statements taken previously by the police, and without hearing him in person. He maintained that he accepted clients into his hotel in compliance with the relevant regulation and that he could not be expected to refuse to offer accommodation to foreign nationals or to question their motives for staying there. 17.  On 3 February 2006 after examining the case on the basis of the case file, the Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Assize Court upheld the decision of the Magistrates' Court. That decision was final. 18.  On 24 May 2006 an official letter was sent to the applicant. It was indicated on the envelope that the applicant was invited to a hearing concerning his case, which would be held on 10 July 2006. The envelope did not show any confirmation that the letter had been served on him. 19.  The applicant's lawyer stated that he had received a copy of the final decision at the registry of the B\u00fcy\u00fck\u00e7ekmece Magistrates' Court on 11 July 2006. In support of his claim, he submitted a copy of the Assize Court's decision, on which a lawyer working at his office had noted that he had been served with the copy in person on that date. That document was later stamped and certified as an authentic copy by the registry of the domestic court. 20.  Following communication of the present application, on 21 December 2009 a public prosecutor prepared an assessment report, summarising the events in the case. He concluded that the final decision had been served on the applicant on 26 May 2006. 21.  On 2 January 2014 both the applicant and the Government were asked under Rule 54 \u00a7 2 (c) of the Rules of Court to provide the Court with a document indicating the notification date of the final decision by 16 January 2014 at the latest. The parties did not respond to that request. 22.

In 1990 the military prosecutor's office opened, of its own motion, several investigations into the ill-treatment and injuries suffered by those participating in the events of December 1989. The main criminal investigation was recorded in file no. 97/P/1990 (currently no. 11/P/2014).

During their arrest they managed to call the Bender police station. 7.  The other two applicants (officers Da\u0163co and Pohila) went to Tiraspol to clarify the reasons for the arrest of their colleagues, but were also arrested upon their arrival. 8.  The applicants were placed in the Tiraspol Remand Centre (IVS Tiraspol). 9.

On 20 June 2006 the Tiraspol City Court issued a warrant for officer Mang\u00eer to be detained for thirty days. On 23 June 2006 the \"MRT\" authorities released officers Mang\u00eer and Condrea. The head of the \"MRT\" secret service declared in an interview that the officers had been released after Russian authorities had \"given assurances\" that Moldovan authorities would not \"kidnap people\" in the \"MRT\". 12.  The applicants were accused in the \"MRT\" media of being members of \"black squadrons\" created for the purpose of kidnapping politicians and other persons causing nuisance to the Moldovan authorities. According to the applicants, during their detention they were questioned by the \"MRT\" secret service and forced to declare that in Tiraspol they had been trying to kidnap \"MRT\" politicians. Officers Pohila, Da\u0163co and Vasiliev were allegedly beaten on the soles of their feet and threatened with the killing of members of their families, as well as with being transferred to cells occupied by common criminals, where they would be ill-treated or even killed. 13.

The applicants described as follows their conditions of detention at the Tiraspol Remand Centre. The cells in which they had been held had been in the basement and had not had access to natural light. In the absence of ventilation and because of overcrowding it had been difficult to breathe.

While in prison, he was examined three times (on 1 and 18 April and on 13 May 2011) by an orthopaedist, who observed that the applicant required physical therapy in the light of a limitation of his knee-joint movement, the atrophy of a thigh muscle, and an injury to a peroneal nerve. On 11 April 2011 the applicant was examined by a neurologist who likewise found atrophy of the thigh muscle and impaired bending of the right foot, which he attributed to an injury to the peroneal nerve. The applicant never received any physical therapy during his imprisonment, instead being offered only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines. 8.

The court held, particularly on the basis of the medical expert opinion, that the applicant had had a motorcycle accident and had required physical therapy as recommended by the prison orthopaedist. However, he had not been given any, either in prison or outside, which had resulted in a deterioration of his health. The court established that, due to the lack of physical therapy, the applicant had suffered atrophy of the thigh muscle and foot drop affecting his right foot. The court compared this finding with the fact that upon his arrival the applicant had not been suffering from foot drop, the pain in his knee had not been severe, and his right leg muscles had been working more effectively. The court emphasised that the applicant had not been offered proper treatment despite a worsening of his symptoms. These changes in his physical condition would not have been irreversible, but the break in the therapy had entailed a prolonged rehabilitation process. The court stated that the rehabilitation process for the applicant would be long and arduous, a situation which could have been avoided had the defendant acted appropriately. The court held that the applicant had suffered physical pain of significant seriousness, which, in turn, had had negative psychological consequences. The court therefore found the applicant's claim for compensation for lack of adequate medical care partly justified. The claim concerning the alleged overcrowding and inadequate sanitary conditions was dismissed in full. The court also ordered the applicant to reimburse PLN 3,186 (EUR 766) for the costs of the defendant's legal representation and PLN 10,932 (EUR 2,628) in court fees (in total: PLN 14,118 (EUR 3,394)). 11.  The applicant did not lodge an appeal against the first-instance judgment. 12.  Following the defendant's appeal against the judgment, on 12 September 2014 the Bia\u0142ystok Court of Appeal (S\u0105d Apelacyjny) amended the judgment, reduced the compensation granted to the applicant to PLN 13,000 (EUR 3,095), and upheld the first-instance court's findings of fact and law. The applicant was not ordered to pay the court fees for the proceedings before that court. This court pointed out that in the experts' opinions it was not specified, even approximately, what the effects of the negligence might be, how much longer the rehabilitation process would take, or how much stronger the pain had become in comparison to pain experienced previously by the applicant."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

The applicant was born in 1969 and is now serving his sentence in a detention facility at Nizhniy Tagil. 6.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7.  On 7 November 2013 a group of nine detainees, including the applicant, was scheduled for a transfer from a police station to a remand prison. A Gazel prison van was available for transfer. It was designed to transport a maximum of seven prisoners, but Police Major V., who was in charge of the transfer, took the decision to take all nine prisoners at once to save fuel. 8.  The prison van was manned by four officers. Driver G. and Major V. were seated in the front, and Officers K. and D. were riding in the rear part of the cabin next to the prisoner cells. 9.  Five prisoners were placed in the large cell in the van, and three prisoners in individual cells. As the applicant was a former law-enforcement officer, the transfer regulations required that he should be separated from the other detainees. However, no other individual cells were available, so he was allowed to ride in the rear together with Officers K. and D. 10.  Approximately half way to the destination, prisoners Sa., Ma. and Mu. kicked out the door of the large cell and attacked the convoy officers. Prisoner Mu. overpowered Officer D. and seized his holster containing a handgun. A struggle for the gun ensued and Mu. fired a shot at the floor. Prisoner Sa. grabbed Officer D. from behind, and a second shot was fired. 11.  Meanwhile, Officer K. pushed prisoner Ma. aside, drew his gun and told everyone to freeze or he would shoot. Prisoners Sa. and Mu. were still struggling with Officer D. for the gun. Officer K. shot at Sa. and hit him. 12.  Major V. came running to the back of the van and opened the door. More shots followed. Eventually, prisoner Mu. released the gun and threw it out of the van. At some point, a bullet ricocheted, wounding the applicant in his left shin. 13.  The applicant was taken to a local military hospital where his wounded leg was put in a cast. On the following day he was discharged and transferred to a prison hospital. 14.  In December 2013 the applicant complained to a prosecutor that he had been injured as a consequence of the grossly negligent actions of convoy officers who had breached the transfer regulations. 15.  On 9 January 2014 an investigator with the Bashkortostan Regional Division of the Investigations Committee refused to open a criminal case. He found no indications of gross negligence arising from the decision to transport two prisoners in excess of the van's design capacity and that not putting the applicant in a cell had been motivated by \"considerations of budgetary austerity and saving money allocated for the purchase of fuel\". 16.  On 4 December 2014 a deputy prosecutor of the Kirovskiy District in Ufa rejected the applicant's complaint against the investigator's decision. 17.  On 30 April 2015 the Kirovskiy District Court in Ufa upheld the investigator's decision as lawful, noting that it had been within his competence to issue such a decision, and that the decision contained no defects of form. On 20 July 2015 the Supreme Court of the Bashkortostan Republic rejected an appeal against the District Court's judgment. 18.  On 14 September 2015 the acting head of the regional division of the Investigations Committee ordered an additional \"pre\u2011investigation inquiry\" into whether an offence of negligence causing grievous bodily harm had been committed. Ten days later the investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings:\n\"... it does not appear possible to establish with certainty that the bullet which hit [the applicant] was shot from the handgun of Officer V., rather than from [the handgun of] Officer D., while it was in the possession of prisoner Mu. Besides, under Article [41] of the Criminal Code, causing damage to interests protected by criminal law is not a criminal offence if the act causing such damage was based on a reasonable risk assessment and sought to achieve a socially useful objective, such as preventing an attempted escape in the instant case.\" 19.  On 8 February 2016 the deputy head of the regional division upheld the investigator's decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings. 20.  On 5 May 2016 the supervising deputy prosecutor of the Bashkortostan Republic set the decision aside and ordered a forensic assessment of the applicant's injury. On 6 June 2016 the investigator with the Central Investigations Department in Ufa again refused to institute criminal proceedings, noting that the applicant's medical record could not be located. It had been sent to the facility where he was serving his sentence and that facility had not responded to the investigator's request for a copy. 21.  In parallel criminal proceedings, on 22 December 2014 the Ordjonikidzevskiy District Court in Ufa convicted prisoners Mu. and Sa. of attempted escape from prison and sentenced them to five years' imprisonment each. Convoy Officers K., D. and V. had been given the status of injured parties in those proceedings. The applicant testified as a witness."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

The applicants, Mr Makhlyagin and Mr Belyayev, were born in 1983 and 1979 respectively and were held in different detention facilities. The facilities' officials opened and/or inspected letters that the applicants exchanged with the Court. 5.  From September 2008 until October 2009 the applicant, detained in a correctional colony, lodged several letters with the Court. All of them were accompanied by cover letters from a chief officer of the colony summarising the content of the applicant's letters. Some letters also bore the colony's registration stamps. 6.  The applicant lodged a claim, alleging that the colony's staff had impeded his correspondence with the Court. On 22 January 2009 the Tagilstroyevskiy District Court of Nizhniy Tagil dismissed his claim 7.  The applicant lodged an appeal with the Sverdlovskiy Regional Court. On 4 March 2009 the Sverdlovskiy Regional Court rejected his appeal, stating that it should be lodged through the first-instance court. The regional court also noted that the applicant could request that the time-limit in respect of the appeal be re-set. 8.  On 30 March 2009 the applicant lodged his appeal with the first\u2011instance court. Instead of requesting that the time-limit in respect of his appeal be re-set the applicant asked the court to restore his case to the list of pending cases. On 9 April 2009 the District Court refused to examine the appeal as belated. 9.  The applicant appealed against this decision. However, he once again lodged his appeal with the Regional Court instead of the first-instance court. His appeal statement did not contain a request for the missed time\u2011limit to be re-set. The Sverdlovskiy Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal. 10.  On 2 November 2010 the applicant received a letter from the Court; the letter was opened by a member of the remand prison staff. 11.  The applicant lodged a claim for compensation. By a final decision of 7 June 2011 the Tver Regional Court dismissed his claim.

The applicants' dates of birth and places of residence are listed in the Appendix. 6.  On different dates between 2012 and 2016 (see Appendix) the applicants learned that their right to leave the country had been restricted and that they were no longer allowed to leave Azerbaijan. 7.  It appears from the documents in the case files that in all the cases the restriction in question was imposed by the investigating authorities, in the absence of any judicial decision, within the framework of various criminal proceedings in which the applicants were not convicted, accused or suspected persons, but were only questioned as witnesses. 8.  The travel bans imposed in respect of the applicants in applications nos. 62775/16 and 43327/16 were lifted by the investigating authorities on 29 January and 21 April 2016 respectively. 9.  On various dates the applicants brought an action claiming that the restriction imposed on them was unlawful, either by lodging a complaint with the administrative courts or applying to the ordinary courts for a review of the lawfulness of procedural actions or decisions by the prosecuting authorities under the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter \"judicial review\"). Some of the applicants used both of the above-mentioned remedies. 10.  The applicants claimed, in particular, that the domestic law did not provide for the imposition of travel bans on witnesses in criminal proceedings and that the restriction on their right to leave the country was not justified. 11.  In the domestic proceedings relating to all the applications, except application no. 66650/13, the domestic courts refused to examine the applicants' complaint on the merits. Final decisions were adopted on various dates, by the Supreme Court in the administrative proceedings and the Baku Court of Appeal in the proceedings for judicial review (see Appendix). In their decisions, both the administrative and ordinary courts declared that they did not have competence to examine a complaint relating to the lawfulness of travel bans imposed by the investigating authorities. 12.  As regards the applicant in application no. 66650/13, by a decision dated 1 April 2013, a judge at the Sabail District Court dismissed his complaint after examining it on the merits. The relevant part of the decision reads as follows:\n\"Having assessed all the examined evidence, I conclude that the actions of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan restricting the right of Mursaliyev Azad Oktay oglu to leave the country are lawful, that the procedure for judicial review as defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Azerbaijan does not provide for a [decision] on the payment of pecuniary or non-pecuniary damages, [and] that, for these reasons, the complaint should not be allowed.\" 13.  On 5 April 2013 the applicant in application no. 66650/13 appealed against that decision, reiterating that there was no legal basis for restricting his right to leave the country under domestic law. 14.  On 12 April 2013 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding the first-instance court's decision justified. The appellate court repeated the reasoning provided by the first-instance court and made no mention of the complaint concerning the legal basis for the imposition of the travel ban."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

From 22 July 2016 the applicant was held in the Chernigiv pre-trial detention centre (\"the SIZO\") as a suspect in respect of a crime. 7.  On 8 September 2016, while being held at the SIZO, the applicant suffered acute myocardial infarction. He was treated at Kozeletsk Town Hospital from 8 until 19 September 2016. 8.  On 27 September and 6 October 2016 the applicant underwent examinations at the Chernigiv Regional Cardiological Centre. He was diagnosed with ischemic heart disease; acute myocardial infarction; third\u2011stage hypertonic disease; a hypertensive heart; and second-degree heart failure. The applicant was prescribed outpatient medical treatment and a further heart examination. On the last mentioned date he was recommended to undergo a cardiac ventriculography test. 9.  On 7 February 2017, in response to a request for information lodged by the Chernigiv regional prosecutor's office, Chernihiv City Hospital (\"the Hospital\") noted that the applicant's state of health posed a high risk to his life. 10.  On 15 March 2017, the Hospital informed the SIZO authorities that the cost of a cardiac ventriculography test was 4,000 hryvnias (UAH \u2013 approximately 140 euros (EUR)). There is no information regarding whether that test was undertaken. 11.  Following a deterioration in the applicant's health, on 23 May 2017 the Court indicated to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that they should immediately ensure that the recommended treatment was available and provided to the applicant and that the applicant was placed in a specialised medical institution for medical treatment \u2013 including surgery, if appropriate. 12.  On 23 May 2017 the applicant was transported to the Hospital, where the previous diagnosis was confirmed (see paragraph 8 above). On the same day he was returned to the SIZO and provided with outpatient treatment. 13.  On 25 May 2017 the Hospital informed the SIZO that in order for the applicant to be provided with qualified medical advice, he needed a cardiac ventriculography test. In view of the complexity of the applicant's state of health, before the cardiac ventriculography test the Hospital requested that the applicant have an additional consultation at the Amosov Cardiology Institute. 14.  According to the Government, the SIZO administration offered the applicant transportation to the Kyiv SIZO in a prison van with a view to his undergoing a further medical examination at the Amosov Cardiology Institute. On 16 June 2017 the applicant refused that offer, arguing that he could not be transported in a prison van owing to his state of health. The case file contains a statement by the applicant dated 16 June 2017 addressed to the head of the SIZO, according to which he did not refuse transportation but insisted on it being in a form that was compatible with his state of health. 15.  Following a further deterioration in the applicant's health, on 22 June 2017 the ambulance took him to the Hospital, where the previous diagnosis (see paragraph 8 above) was confirmed, electrocardiography and cardiac ventriculography tests were recommended, and he was prescribed some medication. 16.  The case file contains an extract from the applicant's medical file bearing no date and signed by the head of the SIZO medical unit; according to the extract, the SIZO had no cardiologist on its staff and high-quality medical treatment was not possible at the SIZO. The applicant did not receive the prescribed medication in full owing to a lack of funds. The extract furthermore stated that he remained under the supervision of the SIZO medical staff and did not require inpatient medical treatment. 17.  On 10 July 2017 the Court reiterated its previous decision (see paragraph 11 above) indicating that the authorities were to ensure that the applicant was transported promptly, and in conditions commensurate with his state of health, to a specialised medical institution to undergo the necessary medical examinations, such as a cardiac ventriculography test, in order that a correct diagnosis could be made and the applicant could receive medical treatment, if necessary. On 8 August 2017 the Government submitted that the applicant had not been transported to a specialised medical institution, as had been indicated by the Court, owing to his refusal of 16 June 2017 (see paragraph 14 above). 18.  According to the available information, from August 2016 until September 2017 the applicant underwent more than fifteen examinations, both within the SIZO and at civilian hospitals, and an ambulance was called twelve times to provide him with urgent treatment. 19.  On an unspecified date the applicant was released from custody. On 7 November 2017 he underwent an examination at the Amosov Cardiology Institute. According to the results of the examination, he was diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, exertional angina (class III), postinfarction cardiosclerosis, and atherosclerosis of the aorta and of the coronary arteries. It was recommended that he undergo surgery for his ischemic heart disease, together with further inpatient treatment.

The applicants or their close relatives participated in demonstrations and were injured or killed by gunfire during the events of December 1989 in Bucharest, Slobozia, T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te and Re\u0219i\u021ba, which led to the fall of the communist regime. 6.  In 1990 the military prosecutor's offices from several cities opened on their own motion criminal investigations into the use of violence against the demonstrators. The applicants' injury and their close relatives' deaths were investigated along with most of the cases in a main criminal investigation recorded in file no. 97/P/1990 (current no. 11/P/2014). 7.

On 1 November 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the initiation in rem of a criminal investigation for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same circumstances of fact. Up to February 2017 further steps were taken in gathering information from domestic authorities, the prosecutor's office contacting 211 civil parties, questioning members of the political party which took over the presidency at the time of events, planning the taking of evidence from military officers and other participants in the events, verifying the activity of the relevant military units and the audio/video recordings broadcast by radio and television. 9.  From March 2017 the military prosecutor examined military and civilian archives, including the vast archives of the Romanian Senate. They also viewed and transcribed more than 400 hours of audio/video recordings. They proceeded with the re-examination of several witnesses. They questioned military personnel involved in the December 1989 military operations and fifty-one members of the political party which ruled at the time and of other authorities. They verified the documents indicating the military units' actions from that period. 10.

The applicant was born in 1974 and lived, prior to his arrest and conviction, in Moscow. 5.  On an unspecified date the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having murdered Ch. He was charged with unlawful purchase and possession of firearms and aggravated murder. 6.  On 11 July 2006 the investigator questioned Sh., who had witnessed Ch.'s murder. Sh. identified the applicant as the perpetrator. On 27 July 2006 she confirmed her earlier statements in the applicant's presence. On an unspecified date Sh. was admitted to hospital and was unable to attend the trial. 7.  On 28 March 2007 the trial by a jury opened in the Moscow City Court. 8.  On 10 April 2007 the jury returned a guilty verdict. The twelve jurors held the applicant responsible for the murder by ten votes to two, and for unlawful possession of firearms by nine votes to three. 9.  By a judgment of 13 April 2007, the Moscow City Court sentenced the applicant to eighteen years' imprisonment. 10.  On 18 April 2007 the applicant lodged a statement of appeal in which he alleged, inter alia, that Sh.'s statement had been read out during the trial in contravention of the applicable rules of criminal procedure. On 28 April 2007 he lodged a supplementary statement of appeal \"in connection with newly discovered circumstances\". He wrote that he had found out that on several occasions the presiding judge had entered the room where the jurors had been deliberating and advised them to declare him guilty. The applicant asked the appellate court to take evidence from the jurors and to quash the conviction. 11.  On 14 May 2007 Judge Sht., who had presided over the applicant's trial, refused to amend the minutes of the trial to take note of the applicant's statement that the judge had been present during the jury's deliberations, had advised them as to how to fill out the questionnaire and had made comments about the applicant's character and guilt. 12.  On 21 May 2007 the applicant's representative obtained a statement, certified by a notary public from N., a juror. The juror stated that during the trial the presiding Judge Sht. had often visited the deliberations room, that he had spoken of the applicant's guilt as if it had been already established and that he had given them instructions on how to fill out the questionnaire.

All applicants were ill-treated and injured on the night of 21\u204422 December 1989 during the events which led to the fall of the communist regime in Bucharest. The applicant in application no. 30392/15 (Vasu v. Romania) suffered injuries that needed twenty-two days of medical care and the other two applicants were beaten by militia forces on the same occasion. 6.  In 1990 the military prosecutor's office opened, of its own motion, investigations into the illegal detention, ill-treatment and injury suffered by the applicants and other participants in the events of December 1989 in respect of several offences as mentioned below. The main criminal investigation was recorded in file no. 97/P/1990 (currently no. 11/P/2014). 7.  At the same time, another investigation concerning the offences of illegal deprivation of liberty, illegal arrest and abusive investigation against a large number of persons, including the applicants, culminated in the committal for trial of senior military and public officials and their subsequent conviction by a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 10 May 1991, which became final on 14 November 1991. It cannot be seen from the court's decision whether the injured persons, including the applicants, participated in those proceedings (see, mutatis mutandis, B\u0103nu\u021boiu and \u0218tefoglu v. Romania [Committee], nos. 64752/13 and 54607/14, \u00a7 7, 3 July 2018). 8.  As regards the offence of improper conduct, the military prosecutor's office decided on 27 October 1993 (Ms Nicoleta-Lorena Giurcanu \u2011 applicant in application no. 30365/15, hereinafter \"the first applicant\"), 9 March 1994 (Mr Traian Vasu \u2013 applicant in application no. 30392/15, hereinafter \"the second applicant\") and 27 August 1993 (Ms Lumini\u021ba Zeleniuc \u2013 applicant in application no. 30410/15, hereinafter \"the third applicant\") not to open a separate investigation of its own motion on the grounds that the offence of improper conduct fell under a subsequently enacted amnesty law; that decision was communicated only to the third applicant on 25 September 2008. No decision was adopted in respect of the applicants' injury. 9.  Further, without a formal decision to overturn the decisions issued by the military prosecutor's office (see paragraph 8 above) and to reopen the applicants' respective cases, in the main criminal investigation, the prosecutor heard evidence from the applicants, who reiterated their complaints regarding the offences of illegal deprivation of liberty and assault and battery, based on their ill-treatment and injuries during the events of December 1989. Thus, the first applicant asked on 29 April 2005 to be joined to these proceedings as a civil party and for the investigation of the case to be pursued by the military prosecutor's office. The second applicant gave statements as an injured party on 7 January 2000 and 23 November 2004. The third applicant raised civil claims on 25 September 2008 and requested that the persons responsible be identified and committed to stand trial. 10.  The relevant procedural steps taken in the main criminal investigation were described in Association \"21 December 1989\" and Others v. Romania (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 12-41), and Sidea and Others v. Romania ([Committee] no. 889/15, \u00a7\u00a7 8-11, 5 June 2018). 11.  On 14 October 2015 the military prosecutor's office issued a decision in respect of the offence of instigating illegal deprivation of liberty, concerning all the applicants, by closing the main criminal investigation on the grounds of res judicata in relation to the Supreme Court of Justice's decision of 10 May 1991 (see paragraph 7 above). In addition, the military prosecutor's office closed the main investigation in respect of the offence of instigating improper conduct regarding the second applicant, as it fell under an amnesty law (see paragraph 8 above). No decision was adopted with respect to the injury and assault and battery complained of by the applicants. 12.  The decision of 14 October 2015 (see paragraph 11 above) was subsequently annulled by a Prosecutor General's decision of 5 April 2016, confirmed by the High Court of Cassation and Justice on 13 June 2016. On 1 November 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the opening of a criminal investigation in rem for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same factual circumstances. 13.

The first applicant (Mr Ryklin) was born in 1958. The second applicant (Mr Sharov) was born in 1956. Both applicants are human rights activists and pro-democracy campaigners. They both live in Moscow. 6.  On 21 April 2015 the applicants, with three others, sent written notification to the Moscow Mayor's office of their intention to hold a demonstration with some 15,000 participants from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. on 6 May 2015 in Bolotnaya Square. After the expiry of the statutory period for the authority's reply, on 28 April 2015 the applicants wrote a letter to the Mayor's office stating that they considered the event of 6 May 2015 to have been approved by the Mayor. 7.  On 27 April 2015 the Regional Security and Anti-Corruption Department of Moscow telephoned the applicants and suggested that the event be held on Marshal Vasilevskiy Street. On 30 April 2015 the Department repeated this proposal in a letter. The event organisers were also warned that if they rejected this proposal they would not be allowed to hold a public event at all. 8.  According to the applicants, they informed all possible participants in the demonstration about its cancellation by way of posting information on the internet and via various mass-media outlets. 9.  At around 7.05 p.m. both the applicants arrived in Bolotnaya Square, where they saw a gathering of some fifty people standing quietly, without any banners. According to the applicants, each positioned himself at a distance from other people with a political banner. The applicants considered that each of them was staging a solo demonstration which did not require prior notification of the authorities. A few minutes later the applicants were arrested and taken to a police van. 10.  According to the Government, on 6 May 2015 the applicants, acting in a group of fifty people, organised and held a public assembly without prior notification being given to the authorities. The applicants called upon others to shout the slogans \"Freedom to political prisoners\", \"Death to fascists\" and others; the second applicant held a banner stating that all \"Bolotnaya participants\" were innocent. The applicants did not respond to the multiple demands by the police that they cease their actions, and at 7.35 p.m. they were taken to the Yakimanka district police station. 11.  According to the records of transfer to the police station (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f) and the administrative arrest records, the first applicant was brought to the police station at 7.40 p.m. on 6 May 2015 and placed under administrative arrest at the same time. The second applicant was brought to the police station at 7.25 p.m. and placed under administrative arrest at 7.40 p.m. The records of the transfer contained an indication that both applicants were taken to the police station for an administrative offence record to be drawn up. 12.  According to the Government, the term of the applicants' retention in the police station was extended to forty-eight hours. On 6 May 2015 at 10.15 p.m. the first applicant was transported to the police station in Zamoskvorechye District of Moscow. On 7 May 2015 at 4 p.m. he was taken to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow. The second applicant was taken to that same court on 7 May 2015 at 4.10 p.m. 13.  At the police stations both applicants were accused of organising and holding a group public event without notifying the authorities in advance, in breach of Article 20.2 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Administrative Offences (hereinafter \"the CAO\"). In particular, they called upon others to shout political slogans; the second applicant had a banner. 14.  On 7 May 2015 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court convicted the first applicant under Article 20.2 \u00a7 2 of the CAO and sentenced him to ten days' detention. The court found that the first applicant, with the second applicant, had organised and held a group public event in the form of a \"meeting\" with about fifty participants, without notifying the authorities in advance. It dismissed the applicant's argument that he had staged a solo demonstration, after considering it as a line of defence. The court also refused to admit in evidence a video recording of the events in Bolotnaya Square, because it was \"undated and did not contain the entire chronology of events preceding [the applicant's] arrest\". 15.  On the same day the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court heard the case against the second applicant. The court reiterated the description of the administrative offence imputed to the first applicant, found the second applicant guilty under Article 20.2 \u00a7 2 of the CAO, and sentenced him to ten days' detention. The court dismissed the evidence of two eyewitnesses who stated that the second applicant had been standing alone on the bridge with a banner. It also refused to admit in evidence video recordings and photographs showing the second applicant, because neither of them contained \"information about the address\". 16.  Both the applicants appealed, insisting that they had staged solo demonstrations. On 13 May 2015 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgments. Referring to the statutory definition of a \"meeting\" (the presence of people in a specific place in order to publicly express their opinions, essentially on social and political issues), the appellate court considered that some fifty people had been present in Bolotnaya Square, including the applicants, who had called on others to shout political slogans."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}

On 23 September 2011 the Consumer Protection Authority declared the applicant's presence in Russian undesirable (the \"exclusion order\") on the ground that he was HIV-positive. 9.  By judgment of 19 December 2011, the Sovetskiy District Court in Vladivostok rejected the applicant's challenge to the exclusion order, finding that it was issued in full compliance with Russian law. 10.

The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Ivanovo. 6.  At the relevant time the applicant was a member of the Ivanovo Region electoral commission. 7.  On 23 October 2003 a deputy head of the Ivanovo Region Department of Internal Affairs ordered audio-visual \"surveillance\" (\"\u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\") of the applicant's office.

The applicant was subsequently charged with abuse of power, an offence under Article 285 of the Criminal Code. While studying the criminal case file he discovered that it contained video recordings of him talking on the telephone in his office. 10.  At the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty. He claimed, in particular, that the video recordings were inadmissible as evidence as they had been obtained unlawfully without prior judicial authorisation. He also challenged the authenticity of the recordings. 11.  On 27 September 2004 the Leninskiy District Court of Ivanovo convicted the applicant of abuse of power and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment, suspended for two years. The court relied on statements by several witnesses, physical evidence, expert reports and the video recordings of the applicant's telephone conversations.

The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan. 7.  In 1990 the applicant started living with Ms T.K. 8.  In 1991 and 1992 they had two daughters, Kr. (born on 1 July 1991) and K. (born on 13 July 1992). The applicant did not register his paternity. 9.  In 2002 the applicant and T.K. separated. Both girls continued living with the applicant. 10.  In 2004 T.K. married Yu.K. 11.  In May 2004 Yu.K. registered his paternity in respect of Kr. and K. However, the girls still remained living with the applicant. 12.  In July 2007 K. stopped attending school, frequently ran away from home and exhibited delinquent behaviour. She allegedly stole her mother's jewellery. 13.  In December 2007, following an application by T.K., K. was placed in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders. 14.  On 18 February 2008 the Kirovskiy District Court of Makhachkala (\"the District Court\"), sitting in a single-judge formation composed of Judge I., granted an application lodged by the administration of the Kirovskiy District of Makhachkala to place K. in a closed educational institution for minors for two years and five months. In taking this decision the District Court relied on the following circumstances: K.'s not attending school, running away from home, vagabonding and leading an anti-social and immoral lifestyle, as well as unsuccessful attempts to discipline K. and her being detained in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders. 15.  On an unspecified date shortly afterwards K. was placed in a closed educational institution for minors in the town of Pokrov, Vladimir Region, some 2,500 km from her home town of Makhachkala. According to the applicant, his daughter's correspondence with him was subjected to censorship by the facility's administration. 16.  In the meantime, the applicant brought proceedings seeking the establishment of his paternity vis-\u00e0-vis Kr. and K. 17.  On 9 April 2008 the District Court established the applicant's paternity in respect of Kr. and K. and annuled the registration of Yu.K. as the girls' father. 18.  At the applicant's request, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Dagestan applied to the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Dagestan for a supervisory review of the decision of 18 February 2008. 19.  The present application was already pending before the European Court of Human Rights when, on 7 August 2008, the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Dagestan, by way of a supervisory review, quashed the decision of 18 February 2008 as unlawful and unjustified, and discontinued the proceedings. The court held, in particular, that in violation of the procedure established by the Federal Law on Basic Measures for Preventing Child Neglect and Delinquency of Minors, no. 120-FZ of 24 June 1999 (\"the Minors Act\"), the District Court had decided to place K. in a closed educational institution for minors in the absence of a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings or a decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the latter, and without her having undergone a prior medical examination. 20.  On 30 September 2008 K. was released from the closed educational institution for minors and returned home."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True"}]}

Following judicial proceedings which ended with a final judgment of the B\u0103l\u0163i Court of Appeal of 8 December 2009, the applicant company obtained a final ruling obliging the Cadastral Authority to register immovable property privatised by it in 1999 and in 2004 in its name. 6.  On an unspecified date the defendant in the proceedings lodged a request for a review of the judgment of 8 December 2009, seeking its annulment on the grounds that in a technical report dated 25 May 2009 it had been stated that the immovable property in question did not qualify as immovable property (\"the review request\"). 7.  On 24 August 2010 the B\u0103l\u0163i Court of Appeal dismissed the review request on the grounds that the information contained in the technical report of 25 May 2009 did not qualify as new and relevant information which could not have been obtained before the delivery of the final judgment in the case. 8.  On 22 December 2010 the Supreme Court quashed the above judgment and ordered a re-examination of the review request. 9.  On 16 November 2011 the Chi\u015fin\u0103u Court of Appeal re-examined the review request and allowed it. The court relied on grounds other than those relied upon by the defendant in framing the request. In particular, the court relied on a Government decision from 2005, in accordance with which the disputed goods had been transferred to the defendant's control. The court quashed the final judgment of 8 December 2009 and ordered a fresh examination of the case. 10.  On 16 August 2012, after examining the merits of the case, the Edine\u0163 District Court again found in favour of the applicant company and required the Cadastral Authority to register some of the immovable property privatised by the applicant company in 1999 and in 2004 in its name.

The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Chi\u015fin\u0103u. 6.  The applicant had a dispute with H. over ownership of a house. He brought a claim against H. seeking acknowledgement of his property rights, as his father's heir, and H.'s eviction from the house. H. lodged a counterclaim, seeking acknowledgement of her property rights to the house as she had built it. 7.  On 20 December 2007 the Buiucani District Court dismissed H.'s counterclaim and allowed the applicant's claim in full. H. lodged an appeal. On 20 May 2008 the Chi\u0219in\u0103u Court of Appeal upheld the earlier judgment and dismissed H.'s appeal. H. did not attend the appellate hearing, even though the summons had been repeatedly sent to the address she had provided in her appeal. A registered letter was returned with a note stating that H. did not live at the address indicated by her. The judgment became final after the expiry of the two-month time-limit for lodging an appeal on points of law. 8.  On 11 May 2009 H. lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court of Justice, stating that she had only learned of the judgment of 20 May 2008 on 23 April 2009. In her application, she indicated the same address as in the proceedings before the Court of Appeal. The applicant asked the Supreme Court of Justice to dismiss the appeal as being lodged outside the legal time-limit.

On 16 October 2009 the Supreme Court of Justice allowed H.'s appeal on points of law, quashed the previous judgments and delivered a new judgment on the merits of the case dividing the disputed house into equal shares between the applicant and H. The court argued that the appeal had not been lodged outside the time-limit because H. had not attended the hearing before the Court of Appeal and there was nothing in the file to suggest that that court had informed her of the availability of the full judgment. The court concluded that without any evidence of the date when H. had learned of the judgment, her appeal was considered to have been submitted on time.

The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Assemini (Italy). 6.  By a decision of 4 December 2006 of the Cantonal Prosecutor of the Hercegovina-Neretva Canton (Hercegova\u010dko-neretvanski kanton; one of the ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) the applicant was granted the reimbursement of costs which she had incurred as a witness in the amount of 519 convertible marks (BAM)[1]. 7.  On 29 February 2008 the Mostar Municipal Court (\"the Municipal Court\") rejected the applicant's request for the enforcement of this decision, deeming it unenforceable. 8.  On 18 September 2008 the Mostar Cantonal Court (\"the Cantonal Court\") quashed this decision and remitted the case for reconsideration. 9.  On 19 November 2008 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution (rje\u0161enje o izvr\u0161enju). 10.  On 19 June 2009 the Municipal Court upheld the objection lodged against this decision. 11.  On 1 April 2010 the Cantonal Court quashed this decision and again remitted the case to the Municipal Court. 12.  On 18 February 2011 the Municipal Court partly accepted the objection against the writ of execution specifically as regards the interest on the main debt calculated from 4 January 2007, and the interest on the total costs of the enforcement proceedings. 13.  On 2 December 2011 the Cantonal Court upheld this decision. 14.  On 19 September 2013 the Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina dismissed the applicant's request for revision as inadmissible. 15.  On 23 December 2013 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina partially accepted the applicant's appeal and thereby found a violation of her right to a trial within a reasonable time, due to the non-enforcement of the decision of the Municipal Court of 18 February 2011 (see paragraph 12 above). It also ordered the Hercegovina-Neretva Canton to undertake measures in order to enforce the decision within a reasonable time. The Constitutional Court, however, did not award the non-pecuniary damage requested by the applicant. 16.  On 21 October 2014 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed that the final decision in question had not yet been enforced. 17.  On 18 December 2014 the said final decision was enforced and the applicant was paid in cash. 18.  By a judgment of the Municipal Court of 3 April 2009, which became final on 16 December 2009, a certain P.M. was ordered to pay the applicant the costs of civil proceedings in the amount of BAM 1,959. 19.  On 31 October 2010 the applicant submitted to the Municipal Court a request for the enforcement of this judgment. 20.  On 14 September 2011, 4 November 2011 and 5 October 2012 the applicant submitted requests for the acceleration of the enforcement proceedings. 21.  On 5 December 2012 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution. 22.  On 13 June 2013 the Municipal Court dismissed the objection lodged against its decision of 5 December 2012, and P.M. subsequently appealed this decision to the Cantonal Court. 23.  On 17 September 2013 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina found a violation of the applicant's right to a trial within a reasonable time, due to the duration of the enforcement proceedings before the Municipal Court. It further ordered the Cantonal Court to urgently rule on the appeal lodged by P.M. The Constitutional Court, however, did not award the non-pecuniary damage requested by the applicant. 24.  On 16 October 2013 the Cantonal Court dismissed the appeal lodged by P.M. 25.  On 11 June 2015 the Municipal Court issued a writ of execution. 26.  On 4 August 2016 the said final judgment was enforced and the applicant was paid in cash on her bank account in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Moscow. 6.  On 2 June 2015 the applicant asked the Federal Migration Service to issue him a travel passport. His application was refused by reference to the fact that he had been convicted on two occasions and given suspended sentences which had not yet expired (see, for details, as regards the first conviction, Navalnyy and Ofitserov v. Russia, nos. 46632/13 and 28671/14, 23 February 2016, and, as regards the second conviction, Navalnyye v. Russia, no. 101/15, 17 October 2017). 7.  The applicant asked the court of general jurisdiction to overturn the refusal, relying in particular on the Court's finding of a violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 in a similar case of Nalbantski v. Bulgaria (no. 30943/04, 10 February 2011). 8.  On 30 September 2015 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court in Moscow upheld the refusal as lawful, finding as follows:\n\"The complainant's reference to the European Court's judgment of 10 February 2011 in the case of Nalbantski v. Bulgaria is unsubstantiated because, in view of Mr Navalnyy's personality, there are clear indications of a real public interest that outweigh the [complainant's] right to freedom of movement.\" 9.

The rights set forth in paragraph 1 may also be subject, in particular areas, to restrictions imposed in accordance with law and justified by the public interest in a democratic society.\n\nFact pattern: 5.  The applicants' dates of birth and places of residence are listed in the Appendix. 6.  On different dates between 2012 and 2016 (see Appendix) the applicants learned that their right to leave the country had been restricted and that they were no longer allowed to leave Azerbaijan. 7.  It appears from the documents in the case files that in all the cases the restriction in question was imposed by the investigating authorities, in the absence of any judicial decision, within the framework of various criminal proceedings in which the applicants were not convicted, accused or suspected persons, but were only questioned as witnesses. 8.  The travel bans imposed in respect of the applicants in applications nos. 62775/16 and 43327/16 were lifted by the investigating authorities on 29 January and 21 April 2016 respectively. 9.  On various dates the applicants brought an action claiming that the restriction imposed on them was unlawful, either by lodging a complaint with the administrative courts or applying to the ordinary courts for a review of the lawfulness of procedural actions or decisions by the prosecuting authorities under the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter \"judicial review\"). Some of the applicants used both of the above-mentioned remedies. 10.  The applicants claimed, in particular, that the domestic law did not provide for the imposition of travel bans on witnesses in criminal proceedings and that the restriction on their right to leave the country was not justified. 11.  In the domestic proceedings relating to all the applications, except application no. 66650/13, the domestic courts refused to examine the applicants' complaint on the merits. Final decisions were adopted on various dates, by the Supreme Court in the administrative proceedings and the Baku Court of Appeal in the proceedings for judicial review (see Appendix). In their decisions, both the administrative and ordinary courts declared that they did not have competence to examine a complaint relating to the lawfulness of travel bans imposed by the investigating authorities. 12.  As regards the applicant in application no. 66650/13, by a decision dated 1 April 2013, a judge at the Sabail District Court dismissed his complaint after examining it on the merits. The relevant part of the decision reads as follows:\n\"Having assessed all the examined evidence, I conclude that the actions of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan restricting the right of Mursaliyev Azad Oktay oglu to leave the country are lawful, that the procedure for judicial review as defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Azerbaijan does not provide for a [decision] on the payment of pecuniary or non-pecuniary damages, [and] that, for these reasons, the complaint should not be allowed.\" 13.  On 5 April 2013 the applicant in application no. 66650/13 appealed against that decision, reiterating that there was no legal basis for restricting his right to leave the country under domestic law. 14.  On 12 April 2013 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding the first-instance court's decision justified. The appellate court repeated the reasoning provided by the first-instance court and made no mention of the complaint concerning the legal basis for the imposition of the travel ban."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "False"}]}
