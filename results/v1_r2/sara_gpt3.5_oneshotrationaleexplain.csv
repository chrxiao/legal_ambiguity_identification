Choice: False

Explanation: In this scenario, there is no ambiguity in the fact pattern. The statute refers to remuneration paid in a medium other than cash to an employee for services not related to the employer's trade or business. In this case, the service provided by Bob, fixing Alice's personal typewriter, is directly related to the employer's typewriter business. Therefore, the remuneration paid in the form of a typewriter can be considered as part of the employment and not falling under the statutory exception.

Choice: True

Explanation: In this scenario, there is no ambiguity in the fact pattern. The statute explicitly states that the remuneration paid could be under a plan established by the employer for employees generally or a class of employees.

choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","False

Adding the phrase ""under a plan established by the employer which makes provision for his employees generally or a class or classes of his employees"" creates an ambiguity because it is not clear whether the disability plan set up for all of Alice's employees includes provision for employees who are disabled and have to be terminated.
