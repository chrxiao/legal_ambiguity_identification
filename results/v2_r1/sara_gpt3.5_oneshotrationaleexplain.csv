Explanation: ","Statute: (B) on each of some 10 days during the calendar year or during the preceding calendar year, each day being in a different calendar week, employed at least 5 individuals in employment in agricultural labor for some portion of the day.
Fact pattern: The fact pattern provides a list of dates on which individuals were employed in agricultural labor, but it does not specify if each date falls into a different calendar week. Therefore, there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern. The criteria of employing 5 individuals in agricultural labor on 10 days, each in a different calendar week, has not been met with certainty. So, the answer is: True.

Explanation: The statute specifically refers to spouses who died during either of the two years immediately preceding the taxable year.

Explanation: There is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern. While Bob maintained the household for Charlie, who fits the description of a dependent under the statute, the statute does not explicitly state whether the deduction applies if the dependent is not the taxpayer's biological child. In this case, since Charlie is Bob's stepchild, there may be legal ambiguity in interpreting whether Bob qualifies for the deduction under these circumstances.",TRUE,TRUE

Fact pattern: In 2015, Alice did not have any income. The exemption amount for Alice under section 151(d) for the year 2015 was $2000. The current year is 2015.
Response: False
Explanation: There is no legal ambiguity in this case. The statute clearly states that the taxpayer must have no income for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins. In this fact pattern, Alice had no income in 2015, which satisfies the requirement of the statute. Therefore, there is no legal ambiguity, and the response is False.

Statute: (B) who maintains as his home a household which constitutes for the taxable year the principal place of abode (as a member of such household) of a dependent (i) who (within the meaning of section 152) is a son, stepson, daughter, or stepdaughter of the taxpayer, and (ii) with respect to whom the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction for the taxable year under section 151.

Bob's income in 2016 was $553252. The current year is 2016.
Response: True
Explanation: There is legal ambiguity in this case. The statute requires that the taxpayer maintain a household that constitutes the principal place of abode for a dependent for whom they are entitled to a deduction under section 151. In the given fact pattern, Alice died in 2014, but the scenario does not specify if Bob and Charlie continued to live in the same household after her death. Without clarity on whether Bob maintained the household as his principal place of abode along with Charlie in the year 2016, there is legal ambiguity in applying the statute to this fact pattern.

choice: True
choice: False
A: True
Explanation: Technically, Alice and Bob do not have a principal abode during the move-in period of over half the year. But since she and Bob have been moving together, it's reasonable to view them as having the same abode (or lack thereof) the entire year.

Choice: True

Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises from the fact that the statute mentions wages of $20,000 or more for agricultural labor, without specifying if the payment should be to one employee or the total wages paid to all employees. In this case, Alice has paid less than $20,000 to each individual employee for agricultural labor, but the total wages paid to all three employees combined exceed $20,000. It is unclear whether the statute requires each individual wage payment to be $20,000 or more, or if it refers to the total amount paid out in agricultural wages regardless of how it is divided among employees.

Explanation: The statute requires the employer to have employed at least 5 individuals in agricultural labor for ""some portion of the day"" on each of some 10 days during the calendar year or preceding calendar year, with each day being in a different calendar week. The fact pattern provides a list of individuals employed on various days, but it does not specify that on each of these days, at least 5 individuals were employed.

choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","In the first scenario, the legal ambiguity is present, so the correct choice is ""True."" The statute requires employing at least 5 individuals in agricultural labor on 10 days during the year, each day being in a different calendar week. The ambiguity arises from the classification of Bob and Cameron's work as agricultural managing, which may or may not qualify as agricultural labor. While some may argue that their roles could be considered as part of agricultural labor, others may contend that it falls outside the typical scope of such employment.

In the second scenario, the choice is ""False."" The statute clearly exempts service performed as a student nurse in the employ of a hospital or a nurses' training school by an individual who is enrolled and regularly attending classes in a nurses' training school.

Alice is entitled to a deduction for Charlie under section 151(c) for the years 2017 to 2019. The current year is 2018.

Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises from the fact that the statute requires that an individual furnishes over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household during the taxable year to qualify for the deduction. In this case, Alice furnished 40% of the maintenance costs for the time period after Charlie was born.

True

Explanation: Legal separation is a specific legal process that needs to be completed under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance to be considered as legally separated, as stated in the statute. While Alice and Bob might be near the end of their process, until the legal separation is officially declared, they are still legally married.

False

Explanation: The statute clearly states that remuneration needs to be $1,000 or more to fall under its purview.

Explanation: The fact pattern presents a situation where Alice is providing a service to Bob and Bob pays her for it.
