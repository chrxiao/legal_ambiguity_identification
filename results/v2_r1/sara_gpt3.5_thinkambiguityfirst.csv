Given that Alice's taxable income is $236,422, which falls within the range specified in the statute ($140,000 to $250,000), we can calculate the tax owed by applying the formula provided in the statute.

By plugging in the values:
$35,928.50 + 36% * ($236,422 - $140,000) = $35,928.50 + 36% * $96,422
$35,928.50 + $34,713.12 = $70,641.62

In this case, the statute specifies that if the taxable income is over $22,100 but not over $53,500, then the tax calculation involves a pre-defined formula of $3,315 plus 28% of the excess over $22,100.

In the fact pattern, Alice's taxable income is $22,895. To determine if there is legal ambiguity, we need to calculate the tax owed by Alice using the formula provided in the statute:

Tax = $3,315 + 28% of ($22,895 - $22,100)

Tax = $3,315 + 28% of $795

Tax = $3,315 + $222.60

Tax = $3,537.60

If the calculated tax matches the tax rate computed using the statutory formula and falls within the expected range of tax liability as outlined in the statute, then there is no legal ambiguity. If the calculated tax does not align with the formula or falls outside the expected range, there is ambiguity.

Given the specific calculation, in this case, the taxable income of $22,895 falls within the specified range, and the calculation of $3,537.60 aligns with the statutory formula outlined. Therefore, there is no legal ambiguity.

Therefore, to resolve this ambiguity, one would need to interpret whether the statute intends to prevent married individuals who file jointly from being claimed as dependents solely in the year they filed a joint return or in subsequent years as well. 

In this case, because the statute does not explicitly clarify whether the prohibition applies only for the first year or for all subsequent years, there is legal ambiguity.

Fact pattern: Alice has a brother, Bob, who was born January 31st, 2014.","To determine whether there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, we need to consider the language of the statute and how it defines the relationships that qualify.

The term ""brother"" typically refers to a male sibling who shares at least one biological parent with the taxpayer.

In the fact pattern, it is stated that Alice has a brother named Bob who was born on January 31st, 2014. However, the statute does not specify the age or date of birth required for a sibling to qualify. Therefore, there may be legal ambiguity in whether Bob qualifies as a brother under the statute due to his age.

In this case, the statute mentions ""a brother"" as a relative who would qualify under the provision. The fact pattern indicates that Alice has a biological brother, Bob, who was given up for adoption.

The potential ambiguity lies in the interpretation of the term ""brother"" in the context of adoption. Depending on the jurisdiction and specific laws in place, the legal definition of a ""brother"" in situations of adoption may vary. Some jurisdictions may consider biological siblings, even if they are later adopted by different families, to still be considered siblings for legal purposes. In contrast, other jurisdictions may have more restrictive definitions that only consider siblings who share the same adoptive parents as siblings for legal purposes.

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity in this scenario, one would need to research the relevant laws and precedents in the specific jurisdiction where Alice and Bob reside to understand how the term ""brother"" is interpreted in cases of adoption.

1. **Age requirements**: The statute specifies that an individual must be younger than the taxpayer claiming them as a qualifying child and be less than 25 years old at the end of the taxable year. In this case, Alice adopted Bob, and Bob was born on January 31st, 1984. Alice was born on January 10th, 1992. The statute requires that the individual claimed as a qualifying child be younger than the taxpayer, which is the case for Bob and Alice. However, Bob is not less than 25 years old at the end of the current taxable year. This would mean that Bob does not meet the age requirement outlined in the statute.

2. **Adoption**: The fact that Alice adopted Bob may also have implications on whether Bob can be considered a qualifying child under the statute. Depending on the legal implications of their adoption relationship, this could impact Bob’s eligibility.

In summary, to determine legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, we would need to carefully analyze whether Bob meets the age requirements as outlined in the statute and consider any additional legal implications related to their adoption status.

In this case, the statute states that if the taxpayer has remarried at any time before the close of the taxable year, certain implications may arise. The fact pattern involves Alice, Bob, and Charlie. Alice and Bob were married before Alice's death in 2014, and Bob remarried Charlie in 2015. The current year is 2014.

To determine legal ambiguity, we need to focus on the timing of events and how they align with the language of the statute. In this case, the statute does not specify if the remarriage has to occur before or after the death of the previous spouse within the same taxable year. The statute simply states ""if the taxpayer has remarried at any time before the close of the taxable year."" 

Given that Bob remarried Charlie in 2015 but the current year in the fact pattern is 2014, there is ambiguity as to whether the remarriage in 2015 impacts Bob's tax status in the year 2014. Therefore, legal ambiguity exists in this scenario.

In this case, the statute states that if the taxpayer has remarried at any time before the close of the taxable year, which could imply that the taxpayer must be legally remarried by the end of the taxable year to affect their tax status.

Looking at the fact pattern provided, Alice and Bob were married in 1992, but Alice passed away in 2014 before remarrying Bob. Bob and Charlie began the process of marriage in 2015, after Alice's death. The current year is 2014.

Given this, the key question is whether Bob's action of starting the process of marriage with Charlie in 2015 after Alice's death in 2014 would be considered as meeting the criteria of remarrying before the end of the taxable year. 

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, we would need to consider if the statute's language allows for the interpretation that starting the process of a new marriage after the death of a previous spouse but in the following year is equivalent to remarriage within the taxable year.

If the statute could be interpreted in multiple ways given the specific details of the fact pattern, then there is legal ambiguity regarding the application of the statute to the fact pattern.

In this case, the statute mentions that if the taxpayer has remarried at any time before the close of the taxable year, this may have tax implications. The fact pattern describes Alice and Bob's marriage in 1992 and Alice's subsequent death in 2014. It then introduces Bob's domestic partnership with Charlie in 2015.

To determine if there is legal ambiguity, we need to consider whether entering a domestic partnership qualifies as remarriage under the statute. Since domestic partnerships may have different legal implications depending on the jurisdiction, it is essential to clarify whether a domestic partnership would be considered equivalent to remarriage for tax purposes in the relevant jurisdiction.

Therefore, to ascertain if there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, one would need to consult relevant case law, tax authorities, or legal experts to determine if a domestic partnership is considered remarriage for tax purposes.

In the fact pattern provided, Alice (the taxpayer) was married to Bob before Bob remarried Charlie during the taxable year 2015. The ambiguity lies in whether Alice's previous marriage to Bob meets the criteria of ""remarriage"" as stated in the statute.

In the given fact pattern, Bob is married and therefore not unmarried as required by the statute to be considered a head of a household. Since Bob does not meet the first requirement of the statute, there is no need to examine the remaining requirements or details of the fact pattern.

Given that Bob is married at the close of the taxable year in question (2016), he does not meet the first condition set forth in the statute, which states that an individual shall be considered a head of a household only if they are not married at the close of the taxable year.

2. **Fact Pattern Analysis:** Bob's spouse, Alice, died on July 9th, 2014. The taxable year has not ended yet at that point. The question arises whether Alice's death being in the middle of the taxable year has any impact on Bob's marital status for that year as per the statute.

In this case, the ambiguity lies in whether Alice's death in the middle of the taxable year fulfills the condition outlined in the statute for Bob to be considered as married at the close of the taxable year.

In this case, the statute specifies that a taxpayer shall be considered as married at the close of the taxable year if the spouse died during the year.

In the fact pattern provided, Alice entered a coma on July 9th, 2014. However, it does not state whether Alice died during the taxable year. The ambiguity arises from whether being in a coma is legally equivalent to being deceased for the purpose of this statute.

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity in this case, one would need to consider whether the phrase ""his spouse died during the taxable year"" would include a spouse who is in a coma and not legally declared deceased at the end of the year.

Fact pattern: Alice is an employer under section 3306(a) for the year 2015 and 2016, and she has paid $453009 in total wages in 2015, and $443870 in 2016.","To determine if there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, we need to carefully analyze whether all the elements specified in the statute are clearly met in the given fact pattern. Here are the steps to consider:

1. Check if Alice falls under the definition of an employer as defined in section 3306(a).
2. Verify if the total wages paid by Alice in each calendar year (2015 and 2016) are accurate and meet the requirement stated in the statute.
3. Confirm if the wages paid by Alice are considered as wages under section 3306(b).
4. Ensure that the employment conditions met by Alice fall under the definition provided in section 3306(c).
5. Calculate the excise tax of 6 percent on the total wages paid by Alice in each calendar year, as mentioned in the statute.

If after careful examination there is any doubt or uncertainty in any of the above steps due to lack of clarity or conflicting interpretations of the statute, then legal ambiguity exists.

In this case, the statute requires that the employer must have employed at least 5 individuals in agricultural labor on each of some 10 days during the calendar year or the preceding calendar year, with each day falling in a different calendar week.

We need to examine the fact pattern to see if Alice employed at least 5 individuals in agricultural labor on each of at least 10 days, with each day falling in a different calendar week. We need to check if these requirements are met for any 10 days within the calendar year 2017 or the preceding calendar year.

In this fact pattern, it appears that Alice employed the required number of individuals in agricultural labor on various days throughout the year. We need to verify if these days meet the requirement of being at least 10 different days in different calendar weeks. If all the days meet this requirement, there is no legal ambiguity. However, if there is uncertainty about whether the days fulfill the different calendar week criteria, there could be legal ambiguity.

In this case, the statute defines an ""employer"" as ""any person who during the calendar year or the preceding calendar year paid wages in cash of $1,000 or more for such service.""

Given this definition, we need to analyze the payments made by Alice to Bob and by Bob to Alice in the fact pattern:

1. Alice paid Bob $3200 in cash for agricultural labor done between Feb 1st, 2017, and Sep 2nd, 2017. This payment is for agricultural labor, not domestic service, and therefore may not be considered under this statute.

2. Bob paid Alice $4200 in cash for domestic service done between Apr 1st, 2017, and Sep 1st, 2018. This payment falls within the definition provided in the statute as it is for domestic service and exceeds $1,000.

Considering the above analysis, there might be legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, as the statute specifically refers to domestic service, and one of the payments made (from Bob to Alice) falls within the statute's definition, while the other payment (from Alice to Bob) does not appear to fall under the statute's scope.

The statute states that payments made upon or after termination of an employee's employment relationship can be exempt from certain conditions if the termination is due to death or retirement for disability.

In the fact pattern, Bob retired at the age of 65, and Alice paid him a retirement bonus. The question that arises is whether Bob's retirement at the age of 65 qualifies as retirement due to disability under the statute. The statute does not explicitly mention retirement at a certain age as a qualifying criterion, nor does it define what constitutes retirement for disability.

In this case, the statute mentions that severance pay is allowed ""upon or after the termination of an employee's employment relationship because of (i) death, or (ii) retirement for disability."" The fact pattern describes a situation where Bob was diagnosed as disabled and retired on Oct 10, 2019, and Alice paid Bob $12980 as a result of terminating their contract due to Bob's disability.

Therefore, the key question to consider here is whether Bob's situation qualifies as ""retirement for disability"" as mentioned in the statute. To determine this, we need to assess whether Bob's retirement was directly linked to his disability and if it aligns with the intention behind the statutory provisions regarding retirement for disability.

In this case, the statute requires that the employer have a plan established to provide for the employees generally or a class of employees in situations of disability. The fact pattern states that Alice did not have any such established plan for her employees' disabilities. Therefore, the key question here is whether the absence of a disability plan established by the employer affects the application of the statute in this context. 

If the absence of a disability plan could be interpreted as noncompliance with the statute, creating legal ambiguity as to whether the payment made by Alice to Bob is valid under the law, then there would be legal ambiguity in this scenario.

In this case, the statute defines ""wages"" as all remuneration for employment, including the cash value of all remuneration paid in any medium other than cash. The fact pattern states that Alice paid $2325 in hay to Bob for agricultural labor. The question here is whether the payment of hay can be considered as part of ""wages"" under the statute.

To assess the legal ambiguity, we need to consider whether the payment of hay falls within the definition of ""wages"" provided in the statute. One may argue that the payment in hay could be considered remuneration for employment, similar to payment in cash or other mediums. On the other hand, payment in hay might not fit within the traditional understanding of remuneration for employment and could be subject to interpretation.

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, one would need to assess how the term ""remuneration for employment"" is interpreted in the context of agricultural labor and whether the specific payment in hay qualifies as such remuneration under the statute.

The statute defines ""wages"" as all remuneration for employment, including the cash value of all remuneration (including benefits) paid in any medium other than cash. In this case, Alice paid $2325 in cash to Bob for walking her dog.

Thus, the key question is whether the $2325 paid by Alice to Bob for dog walking falls within the definition of ""wages"" provided in the statute. If the payment is considered remuneration for employment, then it may be classified as ""wages"" under the statute. However, if the payment is for a personal service that does not constitute employment, it may not be considered ""wages.""

Therefore, to determine legal ambiguity, one would need to consider the nature of the arrangement between Alice and Bob regarding the dog walking services and whether it constitutes employment under the statute.

Furthermore, while the fact provides the location of Alice's employment as Arlington, Virginia, it is not stated how this location impacts the application of the statute.

user: Statute:     (6) service performed in the employ of the United States Government

Fact pattern: Alice was paid $73200 in 2017 as an employee of Palantir, a company that contracts with the United States Government, in Arlington, Virginia, USA.","To determine if there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, we need to analyze whether Alice's employment with Palantir, a company that contracts with the United States Government, falls under the category of ""service performed in the employ of the United States Government"" as stated in the statute.

First, we need to determine the nature of the work Alice performed for Palantir. If Alice was directly working for a department or agency of the United States Government under a contract with Palantir, her service could be considered as performed in the employ of the United States Government and would likely fall under the statute.

However, if Alice was not directly employed by a government agency or department and was solely an employee of Palantir, it may not meet the criteria of ""service performed in the employ of the United States Government"" as outlined in the statute.

Therefore, the legal ambiguity lies in the interpretation of whether Alice's employment with a company that contracts with the United States Government qualifies as service performed in the employ of the United States Government according to the statute.

This would involve examining any definitions provided in the statute itself, as well as interpreting any relevant case law or legal commentary that clarifies the scope of the provision.

In this case, the fact pattern states that Alice is an employee of the Virginia State Government, not the United States Government.

Analyzing the fact pattern, it is clear that Alice is employed by a private company, Bertha's Mussels, and not directly by the State of Maryland or any political subdivision. Therefore, the key issue is whether employment by a private company in a specific location (Baltimore, Maryland) falls under the purview of the statute.

If there is ambiguity in the interpretation of the statute, it would arise from the potential broadness or narrowness of the term ""political subdivision"" and how it applies to private employment within a particular geographic location, in this case, Baltimore, Maryland.

Fact pattern: Alice has paid $3200 to Bob for work done from Feb 1st, 2017 to Sep 2nd, 2017, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.","To determine whether there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, we need to focus on the key elements of the statute and the specifics of the fact pattern.

The statute mentions that the work must be performed by an employee for the person employing him, and it must be within the United States. In the fact pattern provided, the work was done in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which is outside the United States. This immediately raises a question about whether the work meets the geographical requirement specified in the statute.

To determine if there is legal ambiguity:

1. **Employee-Employer Relationship**: We need to establish whether Bob is an employee of Alice, as the statute explicitly mentions that the work must be done by an employee for the person employing him.

2. **Location of Work**: Since the statute specifically states that the work must be done within the United States, we need to determine if the work done in Toronto, Ontario, Canada meets this requirement.

Based on the above considerations, we can identify legal ambiguity:

- If Bob is considered an employee of Alice and the location of work in Canada does not disqualify the arrangement under the statute, there is legal ambiguity.

The statute states ""a joint return."" This phrase typically refers to a tax filing status where a married couple combines their income and deductions on a single tax return. In the fact pattern, Alice and Bob have been married since February 3rd, 2017, and they file a joint return for 2017. This implies that Alice and Bob are eligible to file a joint return for the tax year 2017.

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, we must confirm if the fact pattern aligns with the requirements set in the statute. Since the fact pattern clearly indicates that Alice and Bob are filing a joint return for the tax year in question, there does not appear to be any legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern.

1. **Statute Language**: The statute mentions ""a surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(a)),"" which implies that certain conditions must be met for someone to be considered a surviving spouse.

2. **Fact Pattern Analysis**:
   - Alice and Bob have been married since February 3rd, 2017.
   - Alice earned $33,200 in 2017.
   - They filed a joint tax return in 2017.

3. **Identification of Ambiguity**:
   - The ambiguity arises from the fact that the statute in question refers to a ""surviving spouse,"" which typically indicates a spouse who outlives the other. However, in this case, the fact pattern does not mention any deaths or survival situations. Instead, it describes a married couple filing joint tax returns.

The fact pattern states that Alice will be entitled to additional standard deductions for herself and for Bob, but it does not mention their ages or whether they are blind. If the statute requires an individual to be aged or blind to qualify for the additional standard deduction, then there may be legal ambiguity in this case.

Therefore, it is necessary to verify if the additional standard deduction provided in the fact pattern aligns with the specific requirements laid out in subsection (f) of the statute.

In this case, the relevant portion of the statute states that a deduction is allowed for the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse is blind by the close of the taxable year and an exemption is allowed for the spouse under section 151(b).

Upon reviewing the fact pattern, we can see that Alice, the spouse of the taxpayer Bob, has been blind since 2014, and Bob is allowed an exemption for Alice under section 151(b) for the year 2017. The only potential ambiguity arises from the fact that Alice became blind in 2014 and not during the taxable year 2017. 

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity in this case, one would need to carefully analyze the definition and interpretation of the term ""blind as of the close of the taxable year.""

The statute specifies that a taxpayer can claim an additional exemption if their spouse is blind at the end of the taxable year and if the taxpayer is allowed an exemption for such spouse under section 151(b). In this case, Alice meets the requirement of being blind by the end of the taxable year, and Bob is allowed an exemption for her under section 151(b). However, there is ambiguity regarding whether Alice's regaining some vision during the year affects her eligibility for the additional exemption.

Given this ambiguity, the determination of legal ambiguity will depend on the interpretation of the term ""blind"" in the statute. If the definition of ""blind"" includes individuals who have regained some vision but are still visually impaired, then Alice may still qualify for the additional exemption. However, if the statute strictly defines ""blind"" as complete and permanent blindness, then Alice may no longer be eligible for the additional exemption once she has started to regain her vision.

2. Determine Alice's exact age to see if she falls within the age requirements specified in the statute.
3. Calculate Alice's total earnings to see if they exceed the threshold mentioned in the statute for unmarried individuals.

If Alice meets all the criteria specified in the statute, then the higher amount of $750 should be applicable to her. However, if there is any ambiguity or uncertainty in the application of the statute based on the information provided in the fact pattern, then legal ambiguity exists.

Now, considering the fact pattern: Alice is not married and has never been a surviving spouse, which aligns with the statutory requirement. However, to assess Alice's eligibility for the higher amount based on her age and earnings, we need to know her exact age and income level.

In this case, the relevant portion of the statute states that the deduction allowable is 80 percent of the amount of the itemized deductions. The fact pattern provides that Alice is allowed itemized deductions of $60000. Therefore, to determine whether there is legal ambiguity, we must apply the statute as follows:

2. The fact pattern states that Alice is married for the year 2016 under section 7703 but does not file a joint return.

Given these points, the potential ambiguity lies in whether Alice, as a married individual under section 7703, qualifies as a surviving spouse for the purposes of the $300,000 limit imposed by the statute.

The fact pattern indicates that Alice and Bob got married in 2012, but they only personally separated in 2017 and did not legally separate. 

The ambiguity arises from the interpretation of what ""legally separated"" means in the context of the statute. Legal separation can sometimes be distinct from merely living apart, and it usually involves a formal legal process with specific requirements set by the relevant jurisdiction. If the statute requires a formal legal decree for separation to be recognized, then the fact that Alice and Bob only personally separated without a legal process could create ambiguity.

Legal separation usually involves a formal agreement or court order that defines the rights and responsibilities of each spouse while they are living apart, which is different from divorce where the marriage is legally dissolved. Additionally, the statute explicitly states that an individual legally separated from their spouse shall not be considered as married.

Therefore, the determination of legal ambiguity in this case hinges on the status of Alice and Bob’s legal separation as recognized by the court.

The fact pattern indicates that Alice and Bob got married in 2012 and were legally separated under a decree of divorce in 2017. 

The key point of ambiguity to consider is the definition of ""legally separated"" in the context of the statute. Is a legal separation under a decree of divorce considered the same as a legal separation under a decree of separate maintenance for the purposes of this statute? If there is no explicit definition or case law clarifying this distinction, there could be legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern.

In the fact pattern, Alice and Bob are in the process of legal separation. The key question to consider here is whether the legal separation process they are going through qualifies as a ""decree of divorce or of separate maintenance"" as mentioned in the statute. If the legal separation process they are undergoing falls under the definition outlined in the statute, then it would be clear that they are not considered married under the law.

However, if there is ambiguity in determining whether the legal separation process qualifies as a ""decree of divorce or of separate maintenance"" as intended by the statute, then there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern.

","To determine if there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, we need to consider the specific language of the statute in relation to the key facts of the case. In this case, the statute states that ""an individual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance shall not be considered as married.""

Given this language, we need to determine if Alice and Bob's legal separation falls under the criteria outlined in the statute. Specifically, we need to determine if Alice and Bob's legal separation qualifies as being ""under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance."" If their legal separation meets these criteria, then according to the statute, Alice should not be considered as married.

In the fact pattern, it is mentioned that Alice and Bob are nearing the end of the legal separation process and that Alice pays alimony. This indicates that their legal separation may involve a formal process to establish separate maintenance or support.

Therefore, to ascertain if there is legal ambiguity, we need to determine the nature of Alice and Bob's legal separation - whether it involves a decree of divorce or separate maintenance. If the legal separation meets the criteria set out in the statute, then there is no legal ambiguity. If the legal separation does not satisfy these criteria, there may be legal ambiguity in applying the statute to the fact pattern.

3. Is Alice entitled to a deduction for Charlie under section 151 for the taxable year?

In this case, Alice is married but files a joint return with Bob, not a separate return, which raises the question of whether the statute applies to individuals who file joint returns. This could introduce ambiguity as to whether the requirement of filing a separate return is a strict condition for the statute to apply.

In this case, the statute specifies that an individual who is married and files a separate return must maintain a household that is the principal place of abode for a child with respect to whom they are entitled to a deduction for more than one-half of the taxable year. 

In the fact pattern, Alice is married to Bob, has a son Charlie, and maintains a home for Charlie. Alice has been entitled to a deduction for Charlie for the years 2017 to 2019. Alice files a separate return.

The potential legal ambiguity arises in the interpretation of whether Alice's home constitutes the principal place of abode for Charlie ""for more than one-half of the taxable year."" This raises questions about the exact timing of when Alice began maintaining a household for Charlie and whether it meets the one-half requirement specified in the statute.

Based on this analysis, to determine whether legal ambiguity exists, we should focus on the specific dates involved—when Alice began maintaining the household for Charlie and whether this timeframe meets the required threshold for the deduction.

In this case, the key element of the statute to consider is whether Alice furnishes over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household during the taxable year. The fact pattern states that Alice furnishes 40% of the maintenance costs since September 16th, 2017. 

To determine legal ambiguity, we need to consider whether the period of time during which Alice furnishes the 40% of the maintenance costs is within the taxable year for which the deduction is being claimed (2018 in this case). Since the fact pattern only mentions the period since September 16th, 2017, it leaves ambiguity about the percentage of maintenance costs furnished by Alice for the full taxable year of 2018.

Therefore, to ascertain whether there is legal ambiguity present in this scenario, we need additional information regarding the total maintenance costs for the entire taxable year of 2018 and the percentage contributed by Alice during that period.

In the fact pattern, Alice is providing and maintaining the household for Charlie since September 16th, 2017. However, the fact pattern does not specify if Alice is also providing and maintaining a household for Bob, her husband. The ambiguity lies in whether Alice needs to provide over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household for both Charlie and Bob to qualify under the statute, or if it is sufficient that she maintains the household for Charlie alone. 

Therefore, to determine whether there is legal ambiguity, you would need to ascertain whether the statute requires Alice to provide over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household for both Charlie and Bob, or if it is enough that she does so for Charlie alone.

In this specific case, the ambiguity lies in the fact that Alice and Bob maintain their household jointly with a perfectly even split after Charlie was born. The statute requires that an individual furnishes over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household to qualify for the deduction.
