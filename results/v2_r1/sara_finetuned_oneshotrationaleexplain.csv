Given that fostering is generally a temporary arrangement, it may not satisfy the requirement of ""claiming"" in this context, leading to ambiguity in the application of the statute.

Explanation: ","Statute: (I) is married at the close of the taxpayer's taxable year

Fact pattern: Alice and Bob got married on Feb 3rd, 1992. Alice and Bob have a child, Charlie, born October 9th, 2000. Alice died on July 9th, 2014. From 2004 to 2019, Bob furnished the costs of maintaining the home where he and Charlie lived during that time. Charlie married Dan on Feb 14th, 2018. The current year is 2017.

False

Explanation: In the given fact pattern, Alice died in 2014, so she is no longer married to Bob in the tax year 2017. Therefore, there is no legal ambiguity regarding the marital status as Bob is a widower in 2017. Charlie, who married Dan in 2018, is not relevant to Bob's marital status for the tax year 2017.

Statute: (B) for the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse has attained age 65 before the close of the taxable year and an additional exemption is allowable to the taxpayer for such spouse under section 151(b)

False

Explanation: In this fact pattern, there is no legal ambiguity regarding the application of the statute. Alice and Bob got married before the close of the taxable year (Feb 3rd, 2017), and since Alice was born on March 2nd, 1950, she has already attained the age of 65 in 2017.

Fact pattern: Alice started splitting her time between her own house and Bob's house on April 15th, 2014. Alice and Bob are not married. The current year is 2018.

Response: True

Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises from the fact that Alice started splitting her time between two households, making it unclear which one is considered her principal place of abode. As the statute requires the individual to have the same principal place of abode as the taxpayer for the taxable year, the fact that Alice divides her time between different households creates uncertainty in determining her eligibility under this provision.

Statute: (B) for the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse is blind as of the close of the taxable year and an additional exemption is allowable to the taxpayer for such spouse under section 151(b).

Explanation: There is no legal ambiguity in this scenario. The statute clearly states that the spouse of the taxpayer is eligible for an exemption if they are blind as of the close of the taxable year and an additional exemption is allowable to the taxpayer for such spouse under section 151(b). In this case, Alice meets all the criteria mentioned in the statute – she is the spouse of the taxpayer, she is blind, and Bob is allowed an exemption for her under section 151(b).
