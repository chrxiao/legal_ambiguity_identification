Given that Alice's taxable income is $102,268, it is below the threshold of $115,000 specified in the statute. Therefore, a key point to consider is whether the calculation specified in the statute applies to individuals who have taxable incomes below $115,000.

If the statute does not provide explicit instructions on how to handle taxable incomes below $115,000, there may be legal ambiguity present. In such a scenario, it would be unclear whether the calculation method outlined in the statute is meant to be applied only to taxable incomes falling within the specified range ($115,000 to $250,000), or if it should also be applied to taxable incomes below the lower threshold.

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, we would need to analyze whether the statute explicitly addresses how to handle taxable incomes below $115,000. If there is no clear guidance provided in the statute, it may lead to ambiguity in its application.

In this case, considering Alice's taxable income is below $115,000 and the statute addresses taxable incomes over $115,000, there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern. Hence, the correct response is ""True.""",TRUE,TRUE

2. The fact pattern states that Alice's taxable income for 2017 is $67,285.
3. It mentions that Alice is married under section 7703.

Given this information, legal ambiguity might arise from the fact that the statute specifically mentions a tax rate for taxable income up to $18,450, but Alice's taxable income is significantly higher at $67,285. The ambiguity would lie in whether the 15% tax rate applies only to income up to $18,450 or if it is a progressive tax system where different tax rates apply to different income brackets.

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, one would need to further investigate additional tax brackets and rates applicable to taxable income exceeding the $18,450 threshold mentioned in the statute. If the statute does not specify clear and distinct tax rates for different income levels beyond $18,450, legal ambiguity exists.

The fact pattern mentions that Alice receives an exemption of $2000 under section 151(c), and she is not married.

In this context, there seems to be no legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern. The statute clearly allows exemptions provided to individuals, such as the one received by Alice, to be deducted in computing taxable income. Since Alice is an individual and received an exemption that falls within the scope of the statute, there is no ambiguity.

Fact pattern: Alice and Bob have been married since 2 Feb 2015. Bob has no income for 2015. Alice and Bob file their taxes jointly for 2015. The current year is 2015.","To determine whether there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, we need to closely examine the language of the statute and compare it to the specific circumstances presented in the fact pattern. In this case, the statute specifies that an additional exemption can be claimed for the spouse of the taxpayer only if a joint return is not made by the taxpayer and their spouse, and if the spouse has no gross income and is not the dependent of another taxpayer.

In the fact pattern provided:
- Alice and Bob are married, meeting the requirement for being spouses.
- Bob has no income for the calendar year 2015.
- Alice and Bob file their taxes jointly for 2015.

The potential ambiguity lies in the fact that the statute mandates an additional exemption for the spouse only if a joint return is not made by the taxpayer and the spouse. However, in the fact pattern, Alice and Bob file a joint return.

Therefore, to determine legal ambiguity, we need to ascertain if the requirement of not filing a joint return with the spouse is mandatory for claiming the additional exemption. If the language of the statute is interpreted strictly to require a separate return to claim the additional exemption for a spouse with no income, then legal ambiguity may exist in this scenario.

In this case, the statute specifies that an additional exemption can be claimed for the spouse if certain conditions are met, including that the spouse has no gross income for the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins and is not a dependent of another taxpayer.

In the fact pattern provided:
- Bob is the spouse of Alice.
- Bob has no income for 2015.
- Bob is not a dependent of another taxpayer.

Given these facts, it appears that Bob meets the conditions outlined in the statute for the additional exemption for the spouse. However, an ambiguity arises because the statute does not explicitly address the situation where a married couple files separately, as in this case. The requirement in the statute for the exemption of the spouse appears to be conditioned on not filing a joint return, but it is not clear whether this includes situations where the couple files separately.

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, we need to consider whether the requirement for not making a joint return applies to all married couples, regardless of how they choose to file their taxes, or if there is an exception or clarification for spouses who file separately.

We would need to look at the specific requirements outlined in section 152, such as the relationship between the taxpayer and the dependent, the amount of support provided by the taxpayer, and whether the dependent meets certain residency requirements. If Charlie meets all the criteria set out in section 152, then there is no legal ambiguity.

To assess ambiguity, we need to consider the definition of a dependent under section 152 of the tax code and ensure that Bob meets all the criteria outlined in that section to qualify as a dependent for the year 2015. 

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, we would need to verify whether Bob meets all the requirements set out in section 152 of the tax code to be considered a dependent for the taxable year.

In this case, the statute requires that Bob, the individual who lived with Alice, has the same principal place of abode as Alice for more than one-half of the taxable year. Since the current year is 2016, we need to assess if Bob lived with Alice for more than half of the year 2016.

Given that Bob lived with Alice from September 1st, 2015, until November 3rd, 2019, it is clear that he resided with Alice for more than one-half of the taxable year 2016. Therefore, there is no legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern.

Given the fact pattern provided, we need to calculate whether Bob has lived with Alice for more than half of the taxable year (2016). Since Bob lived with Alice from September 1, 2015, to May 3, 2016, we need to count the number of days Bob lived with Alice during the taxable year 2016. 

To do this, we can count the days from January 1, 2016, to May 3, 2016. If this period is more than half of the year (more than 182 days in a non-leap year), then Bob meets the requirement of living with Alice for more than half of the taxable year.

Therefore, if the calculation confirms that Bob lived with Alice for more than half of the taxable year 2016, there is no legal ambiguity.

Bob has been providing for Charlie from 2004 to 2019 and is entitled to a deduction for Charlie under section 151(c). 

The legal ambiguity lies in whether Bob, as the surviving parent after Alice's death, can be considered as maintaining a household that constitutes the principal place of abode of Charlie's mother, Alice, who passed away. While Bob is entitled to a deduction for Charlie and has been maintaining the household where they live, the statute specifically references the principal place of abode of the father or mother of the taxpayer.

Fact pattern: Alice is an employer under section 3306(a) for the year 2015 and 2016, and she has paid $453009 in total wages in 2015, and $443870 in 2016.","To determine if there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, we need to carefully review the language of the statute and compare it to the facts presented in the fact pattern.

In the fact pattern, Alice pays Bob $2325 in hay for agricultural labor. The key question to consider here is whether the payment of $2325 in hay qualifies as ""all remuneration for employment"" as defined in the statute. This requires interpreting whether the non-monetary payment in hay constitutes remuneration for Bob's employment.

If there is uncertainty or differing interpretations regarding whether the payment in hay can be considered as remuneration for employment under the statute, then legal ambiguity exists.

2. The statute does not specify whether the agricultural labor must be conducted within the United States or in a foreign country. In this case, the agricultural business is located in Caracas, Venezuela.

3. The fact pattern mentions that both Alice and Bob are American citizens. The statute does not specify any nationality requirements.

To determine if there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to this fact pattern, we need to assess whether the requirement of paying $20,000 or more in cash to individuals employed in agricultural labor includes payments made to individuals managing agricultural businesses located outside the United States and whether citizenship plays a role in the application of the statute.

2. Does the statute consider remuneration paid to individuals for agricultural labor performed in a foreign country, such as Caracas, Venezuela?
3. Is the fact that Alice is an American employer relevant in determining how the statute applies in this case?

After considering these factors, if there is uncertainty or differing interpretations regarding how the statute applies to the fact pattern (for example, ambiguity around whether payments made abroad are included in the calculation of the $20,000 threshold), then there is legal ambiguity.

The fact pattern involves Alice as the employer who has paid $23,200 in cash to Bob for managing an agricultural business. 

The potential point of legal ambiguity lies in the location of the agricultural business where Bob is employed. The statute does not explicitly clarify whether the agricultural business must be located within the United States for the requirement to be met. Since the fact pattern indicates that the agricultural business is located in Caracas, Venezuela, there may be ambiguity regarding whether this payment to Bob, for managing agricultural labor outside the United States, would meet the statutory requirement.

In this case, the statute specifies that service performed in the employ of a hospital by a patient of such hospital is exempt from certain regulations. The fact pattern presents a situation where Alice, who was a patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital, performed services at the same hospital and received payment for it.

The potential ambiguity lies in the interpretation of whether Alice's service performed at the hospital, after being a patient there, falls within the exemption outlined in the statute. Specifically, we need to assess whether the statute considers services performed by a former patient who is no longer under medical care at the hospital as qualifying for the exemption.

In the fact pattern, Alice performed in a medical experimental study at Johns Hopkins Hospital and was also a patient at the same hospital during the relevant time period. The ambiguity lies in whether Alice's participation in the medical experimental study qualifies as ""service performed in the employ of a hospital"" as stated in the statute. 

Given that the term ""service"" is not clearly defined in the statute, it could be interpreted broadly or narrowly, which leaves room for ambiguity. If the medical experimental study is considered a service provided by the hospital, then the statute would apply. However, if the study is not considered a service in the context of the statute, then the statute may not apply.

In the fact pattern provided, the work was done in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which is outside the United States. Therefore, there is a clear discrepancy between the requirement of the statute and the location where the work was performed in the fact pattern.

Based on the mismatch between the requirement of the statute and the location where the work was conducted in the fact pattern, we can conclude that there is no legal ambiguity in this case.

In this case, Bob helping Alice with errands may not fall under a traditional employer-employee relationship unless there is more to their arrangement that establishes Bob as an employee.

Given these factors, the potential ambiguity lies in the nationality of the employer, as the fact pattern does not specify if Alice is an American employer or not. If Alice is indeed an American employer, then there is no ambiguity as the statute would apply. However, if Alice is not an American employer, there may be ambiguity as to whether the statute applies in this specific case.

Fact pattern: In 2016, Alice's income was $567192. Alice is married for the year 2016 under section 7703. Alice does not file a joint return.","To determine if there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, we need to analyze the relevant provisions. In this case, the statute specifies that for a married individual filing a separate return, the amount applicable is half of what it would be for an individual not filing a separate return.

In the fact pattern provided, Alice is married and files a separate return. The ambiguity arises in the interpretation of whether the statute refers to the amount applicable under subparagraph (A) being halved, or if it refers to the actual income of the individual being halved.

If the statute's intention is to halve the amount applicable under subparagraph (A), then Alice's income would still be $567192. However, if the statute is interpreted as halving the actual income of the individual, then Alice's income for the purposes of this statute would be $283596.

In this case, Bob died on September 16th, 2017, which was still within the 2017 taxable year. Since Bob's marital status changed during his taxable year due to his spouse's death, the determination of whether he is considered married for the entire taxable year should be made as of the time of his spouse's death, not the close of the taxable year.

Given the specific timeline provided, there is no legal ambiguity in this case. The statute clearly states that if a spouse dies during the taxable year, the determination of whether an individual is married should be made as of the time of such death.

In this case, the statute states that ""an individual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce... shall not be considered as married."" 

Given the fact pattern provided, Alice obtained a decree of divorce from Bob on September 16th, 2017. However, the statute does not specify if the legal separation applies retroactively to the date of the decree of divorce or if it only applies from the date of the decree going forward.

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, we need to ascertain whether the statute's language can be interpreted to include the period before the decree of divorce was obtained when considering the marriage status of Alice and Bob in the current year of 2012.

If the interpretation of the statute is unclear on whether the legal separation under a decree of divorce retroactively affects the marital status, then there would be legal ambiguity.

Therefore, the key question would be whether Alice and Bob's personal separation on September 16th, 2017, would qualify as a legal separation under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance as required by the statute.

Given that Alice and Bob personally separated but did not obtain a formal decree of divorce or separate maintenance, there may be legal ambiguity in determining whether their personal separation aligns with the statutory requirements for legal separation.

Given the statute's language and the fact pattern, the ambiguity arises from the timing of events. The statute considers individuals legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance as not married. However, legal separation typically occurs after the decree is finalized, not at the beginning of the separation process. In this case, since the legal separation process began in 2018 and the current year is 2012, it is unclear whether Alice and Bob are already considered legally separated under the statute in the present year.
