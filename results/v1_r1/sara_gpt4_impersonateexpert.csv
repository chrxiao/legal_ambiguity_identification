Tax calculation:
39.6% of $365,572 = 0.396 * $365,572 = $144,806.51

Fact pattern: Alice is a head of household for the year 2017. Alice's taxable income for the year 2017 is $194512.","Given the statute and the fact pattern:

- The statute clearly stipulates that if the taxable income is over $127,500 but not over $250,000, the amount payable is $33,385 plus 36% of the excess over $127,500.
- Alice's taxable income for the year 2017 is $194,512. This falls within the specified range of over $127,500 but not over $250,000.

To calculate the tax based on the statute:
1. Determine the excess over $127,500: $194,512 - $127,500 = $67,012.
2. Calculate 36% of this excess: 36% of $67,012 = $24,124.32.
3. Add this to $33,385: $33,385 + $24,124.32 = $57,509.32.

Fact pattern: Alice's taxable income for the year 2017 is $102268. Alice is not married, is not a surviving spouse, and is not a head of household in 2017.","To apply the provided statute to Alice's situation, we calculate the tax on Alice's taxable income of $102,268 as follows:

Alice's taxable income is over $53,500 but not over $115,000, so we apply the formula provided in the statute:

- $12,107 is the fixed amount of tax.
- The excess over $53,500 in Alice's case is $102,268 - $53,500 = $48,768.
- 31% of this excess amount is 0.31 * $48,768 = $15,118.08.

Adding the fixed amount to the calculated percentage of the excess, the total tax is $12,107 + $15,118.08 = $27,225.08.

Taxable income: $718,791

The statute outlines a tax calculation method where, for taxable income over $250,000, the base tax is $79,772, plus 39.6% of the amount over $250,000.

Calculation for Alice: 
Alice's excess over $250,000 = $718,791 - $250,000 = $468,791.

Tax on excess: 39.6% of $468,791 = $185,721.04

Total tax: $79,772 + $185,721.04 = $265,493.04

Alice files a separate return.","Given that Alice's taxable income is $554,313 and she files a separate return while being married under section 7703 for the year 2017, the specific statute provided is used to calculate the tax amount based on her income:

- The portion of the statute provided suggests a specific tax formula for taxable income over $125,000.
- Alice's taxable income is $554,313, which is indeed over $125,000.

The statute itself seems clear in terms of the calculation method for incomes exceeding $125,000. It states that $37,764.25 plus 39.6% of the excess over $125,000 should be calculated as the tax amount.

Therefore, based on the information provided:
- Fact Pattern: Alice has taxable income well over the threshold mentioned in the statute and is subject to the specific tax calculation method indicated.
- Statute: Provides a clear formula for calculating taxes on incomes over $125,000.

Fact pattern: Alice is married under section 7703 for the year 2017. Alice's taxable income for the year 2017 is $554313. Alice files a separate return.","To determine if there is ambiguity in applying the given statute to the fact pattern, let's calculate the tax based on the provided statute:

Taxable income: $554,313

The statute applies a specific dollar amount plus a percentage of the income over a threshold. According to the statute:
- $37,764.25 is the base amount of tax.
- The excess taxable income over $125,000 is taxed at 39.6%.

Excess over $125,000 = $554,313 - $125,000 = $429,313

Tax on the excess at 39.6% = 39.6% of $429,313 = $170,009.55

Total tax = Base tax + Tax on the excess = $37,764.25 + $170,009.55 = $207,773.80

Ambiguity could arise from the application of rules concerning a taxpayer's filing status, especially considering Alice is married but files a separate return. The statute does not specify different rates or thresholds for different filing statuses, such as married filing separately or married filing jointly, or for individuals. Therefore, if the statute is universally applied regardless of filing status, there is no ambiguity in the calculation of the tax based on the given fact pattern.

However, in the context of tax law, rates and thresholds often vary by filing status. Given that the statute provided does not specify different treatments for different filing statuses, and Alice's specific filing status might affect her tax calculation in ways not accounted for by this formula (e.g., the statute's applicability to someone married filing separately might not be the same as for others), there is potential for ambiguity regarding how the statute applies to her situation due to her unique filing status under section 7703.

Fact pattern: Alice's income in 2015 is $276932. Alice is not married. The applicable amount according to section 68(b) is $250000.","To determine whether there is ambiguity, let's break down the statute and apply it to the fact pattern provided.

1. **Understanding the Statute:**
   - The statute defines ""applicable percentage"" as 2 percentage points for each $2,500 (or fraction thereof) by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable amount specified in section 68(b).
   - For married individuals filing separately, the increment is based on each $1,250 instead of $2,500.
   - The applicable percentage cannot exceed 100%.

2. **Applying the Facts:**
   - Alice's income: $276,932
   - Applicable amount under section 68(b): $250,000
   - Alice is not married.

Since Alice's income exceeds the applicable amount by $26,932, we calculate the applicable percentage based on increments of $2,500 (as Alice is not married).

\[ \frac{26,932}{2,500} = 10.7728 \]

Rounded to the next increment because the statute specifies ""or fraction thereof,"" we consider 11 increments of $2,500.

\[ 11 \times 2\% = 22\% \]

The calculated percentage is 22%, which is below the maximum cap of 100%.

**Conclusion:** Based on the given statute and fact pattern, the calculation of the ""applicable percentage"" can be determined without ambiguity using straightforward arithmetic.

On May 3rd, 2016, Alice got engaged to Charlie, and started splitting her time between the home with Bob and Charlie's home. The current year is 2015.","To determine if there is ambiguity, let's calculate the days Alice and Bob lived in the same home within the taxable year and compare it to the statute's requirements.

From September 1st, 2015, to December 31st, 2015, Alice and Bob lived together. This period is 122 days (31 days in October, 30 in November, 31 in December, plus 30 days in September).

The taxable year begins on January 1st, 2016. Alice and Bob lived together from January 1st, 2016, to May 3rd, 2016. This period is 123 days (31 days in January, 29 in February - accounting for 2016 being a leap year, 31 in March, 30 in April, plus 3 days in May).

Adding these two periods together, Alice and Bob lived in the same home for 245 days (122 days in 2015 + 123 days in 2016) within the taxable year of 2016.

A taxable year typically spans from January 1st to December 31st. For more than half of the taxable year (which would be more than 182.5 days in a non-leap year, or more than 183 days in a leap year like 2016), they need to have the same principal place of abode.

Given Alice and Bob lived together for 245 days during the 2016 taxable year, they satisfy the condition noted in the statute for more than half of the year.

On May 3rd, 2016, Alice bought a new property, which she and Bob are still in the process of moving into. The current year is 2016.","To evaluate whether there is ambiguity, we need to calculate the days Alice and Bob lived together and understand what constitutes ""principal place of abode.""

From September 1, 2015, to May 3, 2016, is a span that includes full months (September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April) and partial months (a few days of May and most days of August). This period covers 8 full months and parts of 2 others.

Let's approximate the count to determine if it meets the ""more than one-half of such taxable year"" requirement. A taxable year typically means the calendar year, from January 1 to December 31, unless specified otherwise.

For the purposes of this question:

- **Total days from September 1, 2015, to May 3, 2016**: The exact number of days varies depending on the specifics, but for general purposes, it's around 8 months and a few days. Since 2016 is a leap year, February has 29 days, making the total days in question around 245 days, considering the leap day and the start and end dates.
- **Days in the taxable year 2016 they lived together**: Since they lived together from January 1, 2016, to May 3, 2016, that's 4 full months and 3 days, totaling approximately 124 days.

Given that 2016 is a leap year, the half of the taxable year is about 183 days (366 days/2).

Now, the statutory language refers to the ""taxable year,"" suggesting we assess the living arrangement from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. By May 3, 2016, they have not lived together for more than half of 2016. However, the ""principal place of abode"" is not clearly defined in terms of whether the process of moving into a new home qualifies as residing together in that new home. This could introduce ambiguity as to how days are counted when transitioning between homes and what constitutes maintaining a principal place of abode, especially if both properties could be argued as principal places of abode during the transition.

Given this, the response to the ambiguity question considering the provided statute and fact pattern is **""True""** due to the potential for multiple interpretations of what constitutes having the same principal place of abode during the moving process.",TRUE,FALSE

Fact pattern: Alice has a son, Bob. From September 1st, 2015 to May 3rd, 2016, Alice and Bob lived in the same home. On May 3rd, 2016, Alice got engaged to Charlie, and started splitting her time between the home with Bob and Charlie's home. The current year is 2016.","To evaluate whether there is ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern provided, we need to calculate the number of days Alice and Bob lived together in the same principal place of abode during the taxable year 2016, and determine if this period constitutes more than half of the taxable year.

The taxable year typically refers to the calendar year, from January 1st to December 31st.

1. From January 1st, 2016, to May 3rd, 2016, Alice and Bob lived in the same home. This period constitutes 123 days (including both the start and end dates).

2. The total number of days in the taxable year (2016, a leap year) is 366 days.

3. To have lived together for more than half of the taxable year, Alice and Bob would need to have shared the same principal place of abode for more than 183 days (366 days ÷ 2 = 183).

Given that they lived together for only 123 days in 2016, it is clear that Alice and Bob did not share the same principal place of abode for more than half of the taxable year. Based on the information provided and the calculations above, there is no ambiguity regarding the application of the statute to this fact pattern.

1. **Taxpayer and Qualifying Child Relationship**: Alice has legally adopted Bob, making Bob her qualifying child.

2. **Age of the Qualifying Child (Bob) at the End of the Taxable Year (2019)**: Bob was born on January 31, 2014. By the end of 2019, Bob would be 5 years old.

3. **Age of the Taxpayer (Alice) at the End of the Taxable Year (2019)**: Alice was born on January 10, 1992. By the end of 2019, Alice would be 27 years old.

4. **Age Requirement as per Statute**: The individual (Bob) is:
   - Younger than the taxpayer (Alice), which is true. Bob is 5, and Alice is 27 by the end of 2019.
   - Less than 25 years old at the end of the taxable year, which is also true since Bob is only 5 years old by the end of 2019.

Given these points, there are clear and direct answers to whether Bob meets the age requirements to be considered a qualifying child of Alice under the mentioned statute. Therefore, there is **no ambiguity** in applying the statute to this fact pattern.

Fact pattern: Alice was born January 10th, 1992. Bob was born January 31st, 2014. Alice became Bob's foster parent on March 4th, 2018. The current year is 2019.","In assessing whether there is an ambiguity between the statute provided and the fact pattern, let's analyze the relevant dates and ages:

- Alice's birth year is 1992. In the current year, 2019, Alice would be 27 years old.
- Bob's birth year is 2014. In the current year, 2019, Bob would be 5 years old.

According to the provided statute, for an individual to be considered a qualifying child under paragraph (1)(C), they must be younger than the taxpayer claiming them and less than 25 years old at the end of the taxable year.

Given the fact pattern:
- Alice is clearly older than Bob, satisfying the requirement that the qualifying child is younger than the taxpayer.
- Bob is less than 25 years old at the end of the taxable year (2019), satisfying that component of the age requirement.
