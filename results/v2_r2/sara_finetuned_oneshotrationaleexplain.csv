Response: False

Explanation: The statute clearly states that an additional exemption is provided for the spouse of the taxpayer if a joint return is not made by the taxpayer and their spouse, and if the spouse has no gross income for the calendar year in which the taxpayer's taxable year begins and is not the dependent of another taxpayer.

Choice: True

Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises in this fact pattern because the statute requires that the spouse be blind as of the close of the taxable year in order for an exemption to be allowable. In this case, Alice began to regain some vision before the close of the taxable year (November 20th, 2017), which raises the question of whether she is still considered blind for tax purposes. Depending on how ""blind"" is defined in the context of tax law and whether partial vision loss would disqualify her as being blind, there is a legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern.

Response: False

Explanation: There is no legal ambiguity in this scenario. The statute clearly states that if an individual is a dependent of a taxpayer for any taxable year, they shall be treated as having no dependents for that year.

Response: True

Explanation: There is legal ambiguity in this scenario. The statute requires Bob to maintain a household that is the principal place of abode for Charlie. While Bob has been maintaining the household for himself and Charlie, the statute does not directly address the situation where one of the spouses, in this case, Alice, has passed away. The ambiguity arises from whether Bob maintaining the household after Alice's death still qualifies under the statute. Additionally, Bob's high income in 2016 might raise questions about his need for the tax deduction and create further ambiguity in the application of the statute.",True,True
