For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), an individual meets the requirements of this paragraph if such individual is younger than the taxpayer claiming such individual as a qualifying child and is less than 25 years old at the end of the taxable year.

Alice was born January 10th, 1992. Bob was born January 31st, 1984. Alice adopted Bob on March 4th, 2018. The current year is 2019.

Choice: True
Explanation: True. While the Organization of Turkic States may be considered an international organization, the fact that it has restricted membership to only Turkic states introduces ambiguity. The term ""international organization"" typically refers to entities that have member states from various nations, so the limited membership in this case raises questions about whether it meets the criteria outlined in the statute.

Bob is entitled to a deduction for Charlie under section 151(c) for the years 2015 to 2019. The current year is 2018.

Response: True

Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises from the fact that the statute in question does not explicitly state whether maintaining a household for a father-in-law (Charlie, who is Alice’s father) would meet the criteria for the deduction. In this scenario, Bob clearly maintained a household, but it is not explicitly clear whether the deduction under section 151 can be claimed for Charlie, as Charlie is not directly Bob's father, but Alice's father. This lack of specificity leads to legal ambiguity.

Response: False

Explanation: In this scenario, there is no legal ambiguity as the exchange of a typewriter for fixing another typewriter boils down to a service provided by Bob, which is within the course of Alice's trade or business (typewriter factory).

Explanation: ","Statute: (3) Age requirements

For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), an individual meets the requirements of this paragraph if such individual is younger than the taxpayer claiming such individual as a qualifying child and is less than 25 years old at the end of the taxable year.
Fact pattern: Alice was born January 10th, 1992. Bob was born January 31st, 1984. Alice became Bob's foster parent on March 4th, 2018. The current year is 2019.
Choice: True

Explanation: In this case, there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern. While Bob is older than 25 years old and does not meet the age requirement in the statute, the fact pattern does not specify whether or not fostering qualifies as claiming an individual as a qualifying child. This lack of clarification results in ambiguity about whether the statute applies in this situation, making the response ""True"" accurate.

Choice: False

Explanation: In this scenario, there is no legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern. The statute clearly states a threshold of $20,000 or more in cash remuneration for agricultural labor, and in this case, Alice has paid Bob $23,200 for agricultural labor within the specified time frame.

The fact pattern states that Bob is a Mexican citizen who was admitted to the USA to perform agricultural labor pursuant to sections 214(c) and 101(a)(15)(H) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which seems to contradict the statute.

The interaction between these two sections is ambiguous, as it is not explicitly mentioned how they should work together in this scenario.
