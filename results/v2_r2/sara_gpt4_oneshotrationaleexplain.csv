The statute provides the formula for calculating the tax owed if the taxable income is over $22,100 but not over $53,500, which includes Alice's income. However, applying the formula ($3,315 plus 28% of the excess over $22,100) directly to Alice's specific situation could be seen as straightforward, yet determining the exact tax amount ($3,315 + 28% of $795) requires a mathematical operation, which might introduce a level of ambiguity in terms of interpreting how the ""excess"" is calculated or applied.",True,True

According to the statute, the ""applicable percentage"" increases by 2 percentage points for each $2,500 (or fraction thereof) by which the taxpayer's income exceeds $250,000.

Explanation: There is legal ambiguity in determining whether Alice and Bob, having got married and filed a joint return in 2015, would impact their eligibility to be claimed as dependents for the year 2015. The statute specifies that an individual cannot be considered a dependent if they have filed a joint return for the year, but it does not clarify whether this applies retroactively within the same year.

choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","True

Explanation: There is legal ambiguity in determining whether Bob meets the requirement of having the same principal place of abode as Alice for more than one-half of the taxable year. The time from September 1st, 2015, to May 3rd, 2016, is slightly over 8 months, which constitutes more than half of the year. However, the ambiguity arises when considering Alice's change in living situation after May 3rd, specifically her splitting time between Bob's home and Charlie's home. The statute does not provide clear guidance on how to assess the principal place of abode in situations where the taxpayer splits their time between two residences within the same year.

This ambiguity arises because the determination hinges on the specific dates and whether the process of moving into the new property affects the interpretation of having the ""same principal place of abode"" for more than half of the taxable year. The answer depends on how the taxable year is defined (e.g., calendar year, fiscal year) and how ""principal place of abode"" is interpreted in the context of moving residences.",True,True

In this scenario, Alice lived with Bob from September 1st, 2015, to May 3rd, 2016. Considering the taxable year is 2016, and given the timeframe, it's ambiguous whether the period they lived together qualifies as ""more than one-half of such taxable year"" due to the division of time starting on May 3rd, 2016.

choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute defines a qualified relative in terms of a sibling relationship or a descendant of a sibling, without explicitly mentioning direct descendants such as children. However, the term ""descendant"" can broadly include direct descendants like sons and daughters. Therefore, in the context of determining if a son put up for adoption still qualifies as a descendant for the purposes of the taxpayer's question, there is a legal ambiguity regarding whether the act of adoption alters the biological and legal relationship for the purposes of this statute.",True,True

choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","False
Explanation: The statute clearly includes ""a brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister of the taxpayer or a descendant of any such relative"" as part of a definition or qualification. An adopted son, like Bob, would be considered a descendant of the taxpayer (Alice), even though the statute does not explicitly mention adoptive relationships.

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute specifies a brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of such relatives as individuals who can be considered for certain legal or tax considerations. However, it does not explicitly mention foster children. Given that Bob is Alice's foster son and not a biological or step-relative as outlined in the statute, there is legal ambiguity regarding whether Bob falls under the purview of the statute for any related legal or tax considerations.",True,True

A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The fact pattern specifies a brother-sister relationship between Alice and Bob, which is directly covered by the statute without ambiguity regarding the relationship type. However, the fact pattern lacks additional context that might be needed to fully determine the application of this statute, such as the relevance of Bob's birth date without additional information on how it relates to the legal issue at hand.

choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute specifies a brother among the relationships qualifying for this stipulation. However, the fact that Bob was given up for adoption complicates the application. Adoption typically severs the legal relationship with biological siblings for many legal purposes. Therefore, whether Bob still counts as Alice's brother for the purposes of this statute depends on interpretations of familial relationships post-adoption under relevant law, leading to legal ambiguity.",True,True

A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute does not explicitly address whether an adoptive brother falls within the definition of ""a brother"" or a descendant of a brother.

choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute specifies relationships that include biological and certain legally recognized step-relatives but does not mention foster relationships explicitly. This omission creates ambiguity surrounding whether a foster brother, such as Bob, would be considered under the statute similarly to a brother, stepbrother, or a descendant of such relatives.

Explanation: ","False
Explanation: There is no legal ambiguity in applying the statute to this fact pattern.

Explanation: In the current year of 2019, Alice is 27 years old, and Bob is 35 years old. The statute requires the individual claimed as a qualifying child to be younger than the taxpayer and less than 25 years old at the end of the taxable year. Although Alice is younger than Bob, she is over the age limit specified in the statute. However, the ambiguity arises because Alice is not being claimed as a qualifying child but seems to be acting in a parental role as a foster parent to Bob, albeit Bob is significantly older and not under 25, which contradicts the typical application of the terms in the statute.

A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute defines a qualified individual in terms of a “child or a descendant of a child.” The fact pattern does not address whether an adoptive father falls within this definition. While in some legal contexts, adoptive relationships are treated equivalently to biological relationships, the statute itself does not specify whether it includes adoptive parents or is strictly limited to biological descendants.

Fact pattern: Bob is Alice's foster parent since April 15th, 2014.
choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","False
Explanation: The statute defines a child or a descendant of a child without specifying the nature of the parent-child relationship, such as biological, adopted, or foster. However, in legal contexts, a ""child"" typically refers to a biological or legally adopted child rather than a foster child, unless specifically stated otherwise. Therefore, the application of the statute to the fact pattern does not present a legal ambiguity concerning the definition of a child in this context.

Explanation: The statute introduces ambiguity in application because it specifies conditions under which an individual can be considered a member of the taxpayer's household, but the fact pattern does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether Bob meets all the criteria set forth in the statute. It's unclear if simply living together qualifies Bob as having the ""same principal place of abode"" as Alice in the eyes of the law and if there are any other considerations under section 7703 that could affect their status.

Since the statute does not directly address these specifics—such as the impact of a spouse's death on the dependency claims or if there's an income threshold that might limit the eligibility for such deductions—it leaves room for interpretation on how these factors impact Bob's eligibility under this statute.

Explanation: The statute specifies eligibility based upon maintaining a home as the principal place of abode of a dependent who is a son, stepson, daughter, or stepdaughter, and for whom the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction under section 151 for the taxable year.

Because Bob was entitled to a deduction for Charlie under section 151 from 2014 to 2017, and Charlie lived with Bob as his principal place of abode during this time, there is not an ambiguity in applying the statute to these specific facts provided Bob's treatment of Charlie aligns with IRS standards for a qualifying child, which based on the information, seems to be the case.",False,True

Explanation: The statute specifies conditions regarding a taxpayer being married at the close of the taxable year. In the fact pattern, Alice and Bob were married but Alice died in 2014. If considering Bob as the taxpayer in question for 2017, there's ambiguity regarding whether the statute's condition applies to him as a widower who has not remarried but has maintained a home for their child.

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises from the phrase ""married at the close of the taxpayer's taxable year,"" considering Bob's marital status after Alice's death in 2014. Given that Bob was married to Alice but she died, and it's now 2017, it's ambiguous whether he is considered ""married"" for tax purposes without further clarification from tax laws or regulations regarding the status of widowed individuals. Additionally, the statute doesn't directly address the implications of the taxpayer's spouse's death on the marital status for tax purposes, leading to ambiguity in applying this statute to Bob's situation.",True,True

In 2017, Bob earned $5254312. The current year is 2017.

A: 
Explanation: ","True

Explanation: The legal ambiguity here revolves around whether Charlie, as Bob's brother and dependent, falls under the category of ""any other person who is a dependent of the taxpayer"" in relation to Bob's entitlement to a deduction under section 151. The statute explicitly mentions dependency and entitlement to a deduction, both of which are met in this fact pattern considering Bob has been furnishing the costs of maintaining the home and has been entitled to a deduction for Charlie. However, the ambiguity arises in interpreting the breadth of the definition of a dependent for this specific legal provision and how it applies to siblings, given that most tax provisions focus on children, spouses, or elderly dependents. The timeframe during which Bob furnished the costs and was entitled to a deduction also plays into this ambiguity, as it could impact the interpretation of ongoing dependency and entitlements within the tax year in question (2017).",True,True

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises from the need to determine if the time period Alice was alive and contributing towards the home, combined with the period after her passing where Bob solely provided for the household, cumulatively meets the requirement of the household being the principal place of abode for more than half of the taxable year for Charlie. The calculation of the time period during which the home was maintained as the principal place of abode for Charlie involves considerations of both Alice's and Bob's contributions and the definition of ""taxable year"" in the context of the household's maintenance following Alice's death.

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: There is legal ambiguity in applying this statute to the fact pattern because it is not clear whether the maintenance of two homes, between which Bob and Charlie split their time, would still qualify the household as the principal place of abode for more than one-half of the taxable year. The statute specifies a need for a household to be the principal place of abode for more than one-half of the tax year, but it does not provide clarity on how this applies when there are two homes maintained and used by the members of the household.

Explanation: In this case, the legal statute is focused on whoever maintains a home that serves as the principal place of abode for more than half the tax year for a qualifying member of that household.

The fact that they are in the process of moving does not negate the fact that for the majority of the taxable year in question (2018), Bob has been providing for a household that served as the principal place of abode for Charlie.

A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute requires that, for an individual to be considered head of a household, the individual must not be married at the close of the taxable year. Bob was married, but his spouse, Alice, died in 2014 which could potentially complicate the interpretation of his marital status for tax purposes in 2016, considering different provisions might apply to widowers. However, it is clear he is not currently married due to Alice's death, which could fulfill that particular requirement. The more complex part of the statute involves whether he can be considered as maintaining a household under the specifics provided, specifically that he has furnished over half the cost of maintaining the household and is entitled to a deduction for Charlie, which seems to be true based on the fact pattern. There is potential ambiguity regarding the definition of ""not married"" as it relates to a recent widow/widower and whether Bob might qualify under any specific provisions for surviving spouses, which is not explicitly addressed in the excerpt given. Thus, the ambiguity revolves around the interpretation of Bob’s marital status in relation to being considered “not married” for the purposes of this statute post-2014, and if the standard provisions for head of household would directly apply to him without any special considerations for widowers within the statutory framework.",True,True

Fact pattern: Bob is Alice's brother since April 15th, 2014.
choice: True

Explanation: The fact pattern does not mention any children.

Statute:     (1) In general <br>  <br>    An individual shall be considered a head of a household if, and only if, such individual is not married at the close of his taxable year, is not a surviving spouse (as defined in subsection (a)), and either- <br>     For purposes of this paragraph, an individual shall be considered as maintaining a household only if over half of the cost of maintaining the household during the taxable year is furnished by such individual.
Fact pattern: Alice and Bob got married on Feb 3rd, 1992. Alice died on July 9th, 2014. From 2004 to 2019, Bob furnished the costs of maintaining the home where he and his father Charlie lived during that time. Bob is entitled to a deduction for Charlie under section 151(c) for the years 2015 to 2019. The current year is 2018.
choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The legal ambiguity in this scenario arises from the intersection of several conditions specified in the statute with the fact pattern. The statute outlines three main criteria for someone to be considered a head of a household: not being married at the close of the taxable year, not being a surviving spouse, and furnishing over half of the cost of maintaining a household. In the fact pattern, Bob's marital status and the death of his spouse, Alice, introduce complexity.

1. Bob was married until Alice's death in 2014, making him a surviving spouse. However, the statute specifies an individual cannot be a surviving spouse to qualify as a head of a household but doesn't clarify the duration for which this condition applies post the spouse's death.

2. Bob has been furnishing the costs for maintaining a home where he and his father lived from 2004 to 2019, which would typically fulfill the financial support criterion under normal circumstances.

3. Given that Alice died in 2014 and Bob is entitled to a deduction for Charlie for the years 2015 to 2019, the conditions imply that Bob might qualify as a head of a household after Alice’s death, provided that being a ""surviving spouse"" does not disqualify him for a certain period following the spouse's death that isn't clarified within the provided statute.

Therefore, based on how the statute's criteria apply to a surviving spouse's temporal qualifications and other aspects of Bob's specific situation, there is legal ambiguity regarding Bob's eligibility to be considered a head of a household for tax purposes following his spouse's death.",True,True

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The ambiguity arises from the interpretation of ""each day being in a different calendar week."" In this fact pattern, Bob was employed on Dec 1 and Dec 2, which fall within the same calendar week. This raises the question of whether these two days of employment can count as two of the ""some 10 days"" required by the statute, or if only one of those days can be counted towards the requirement due to the stipulation regarding calendar weeks.

A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: There is legal ambiguity because the statute requires a total of $20,000 or more in wages paid for agricultural labor within a calendar year for it to apply, and the combined wages Alice paid ($6771 + $6954 + $6872 = $20,597) exceed this threshold within the year 2017. However, the fact pattern also mentions wages paid by Bob to Alice in a timeframe that overlaps two years (2017-2018), which could confuse the issue but doesn't directly apply to the statute's criteria focused on Alice's actions. The ambiguity arises not from the application of the statute to the presented facts concerning Alice but from the additional, possibly irrelevant information about Bob's payments. The primary concern is whether the statute applies to the aggregate of payments Alice made, which it does based on the provided numbers, but the inclusion of Bob's payments to Alice introduces potential confusion about what wages are considered.",True,True

Additionally, Bob's payment to Alice adds another layer of complexity, as it's not specified whether Bob's payments could be aggregated with Alice's payments to reach the threshold or apply separately, especially given the overlap of the employment dates across two calendar years (2017 and 2018). The statute's application depends on whether it allows for aggregation of payments across different employees and whether payments made across two calendar years can satisfy the ""during the calendar year or the preceding calendar year"" condition.",True,True

While Bob paid Alice more than the threshold amount for domestic service, this service was performed in a property he rents out. The statute does not explicitly address the scenario of domestic services provided in rental properties, which could have distinct implications compared to a strictly private home, local college club, or college fraternity/sorority setting.

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: There is legal ambiguity regarding whether the payment made by Alice to Bob due to the termination of their contract because of Bob's disability falls under the auspices of a plan established by the employer for the benefit of employees or is merely a discretionary act on the part of Alice. The statute specifies payments under a plan for employees or class of employees, but in this fact pattern, Alice had no such plan established specifically for situations involving disability. Therefore, it's ambiguous whether Alice's payment would be considered under the purview of this statute given the absence of an established plan covering disability.",True,True

choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","False
Explanation: The statute specifically addresses remuneration for agricultural labor, which revolves around farming practices, including planting, cultivating, and harvesting crops or raising livestock.

choice: True

Explanation: The statute specifies that remuneration paid in any medium other than cash to an employee for services not in the course of the employer's trade or business is relevant. However, the fact pattern describes a situation where Alice paid Bob in cash for a service (painting her house) that is not related to the trade or business (typewriter factory) they are involved in. This introduces a legal ambiguity because the statute is specifically about non-cash payments, but the fact involves a cash payment for a service outside the employer's business. This discrepancy leads to uncertainty about whether the payment for house painting would fall under a different legal treatment, given it was made in cash rather than in another medium, despite clearly being for services outside of the trade or business.",True,True

Explanation: There is legal ambiguity regarding whether the payment made by Alice to Bob for painting Alice's house falls under the statute, as the statute specifies remuneration ""not in cash"" and ""not in the course of the employer's trade or business."" The fact pattern involves a payment made with a check (a form of cash equivalent) for services not related to the regular business operations (painting Alice's house, which is not part of the typewriter factory's operations).

Explanation: There is legal ambiguity here because the statute applies to remuneration paid in any medium other than cash for services not in the course of the employer's trade or business. The fact that Bob, an employee at the typewriter factory, was given a typewriter (non-cash payment) for typing up Alice's personal notebooks (a service not in the course of Alice's trade or business, which is manufacturing typewriters) fits the statute's criteria.

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute specifies services performed by a student ""who is enrolled and is regularly attending classes"" at the educational institution. Given that Alice was no longer enrolled or attending classes at Johns Hopkins University in 2017, the year she was paid for her services, there is legal ambiguity as to whether the statute applies to her situation.

Although Alice was enrolled at Johns Hopkins University within the timeframe mentioned, the fact pattern also states that Alice ""mostly skipped class"" which could potentially invalidate the ""regularly attending classes"" requirement depending on interpretation.

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises from the informal arrangement between Alice and Bob and whether Bob's help with errands, compensated by $200 as a token of gratitude, constitutes ""performed by an employee for the person employing him"" within the meaning of the statute. The statute specifically refers to an employment relationship, but the fact pattern does not clearly establish whether Bob's occasional help and the subsequent payment qualify as an employer-employee relationship under the law.

In this case, Bob, an American citizen, was paid by Alice, an American employer, for work done in Venezuela, which fits the basic criteria.

Fact pattern: In 2017, Alice was paid $33200. She is allowed deductions under section 151 of $2000 for the year 2017. She is allowed an itemized deduction of $4252 in 2017.
choice: True

A: 
Explanation: ","False
Explanation: In this situation, it is clear that Alice's ""taxable income"" would be her gross income ($33,200) minus her deductions. Since both the deductions under section 151 ($2,000) and the itemized deduction ($4,252) are allowed by the chapter mentioned in the statute, there's no ambiguity. Alice simply needs to decide which deduction (standard or itemized) offers her the greater tax advantage, a decision explicitly permitted under the statute as it references deductions allowed by this chapter other than the standard deduction.

A: 
Explanation: ","False
Explanation: The statute clearly applies to individuals who do not itemize their deductions, specifying how their taxable income is calculated.

A: 
Explanation: ","False
Explanation: The statute clearly defines how to calculate ""taxable income"" for individuals who do not itemize their deductions, stating it is the adjusted gross income minus any allowable deductions outlined in the law. In the fact pattern, Alice decides not to itemize her deductions and is allowed a deduction under a specific section of the law.

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises from determining if the limitation on the basic standard deduction applies to Alice. The statute specifies the limitation in the case of an individual for whom a deduction under section 151 is allowable to another taxpayer. In this fact pattern, Alice is not entitled to a deduction for Bob under section 151, which could initially suggest that this limitation doesn’t apply. However, the ambiguity lies in whether the reference to ""another taxpayer"" could imply a scenario where Bob, even though earning only $10 and potentially not being a significant contributor to the household income, could be considered a taxpayer who might claim Alice for a deduction under different circumstances, or if the law envisages situations where married individuals filing separately might be impacted by this statute differently.

A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute applies to situations where either spouse itemizes deductions while married individuals file separate returns.

Explanation: The statute mentions an ""estate or trust"" as part of its criteria. The fact pattern describes the Walter Brown Family Trust II as a ""business trust."" Given the statute's explicit inclusion of trusts and the fact pattern's description of the entity as a trust, there's potential ambiguity in applying the statute to the fact pattern because it depends on whether a ""business trust"" falls under the same classification as an ""estate or trust"" for the purposes of this statute.

Explanation: The statute specifies conditions under which an additional exemption is available for a spouse if the spouse is blind as of the close of the taxable year. Although Alice began to regain some vision before the end of the year, the fact pattern does not specify the degree of vision regained nor does it indicate that she is no longer legally blind. Given that the conditions specified in the statute are met—Alice was blind for a significant portion of the year and Bob is allowed an exemption for her under section 151(b)—there is no legal ambiguity regarding the application of the statute to this fact pattern.

A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute specifies that an individual must be legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance to not be considered as married. Since Alice and Bob are only personally separated and have not obtained a legal decree, there is ambiguity regarding their marital status in the application of any law or regulation that depends on one's marital status.

Explanation: The statute specifies that an individual is not considered as married if they are ""legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance."" However, the fact pattern states that Alice and Bob are currently ""in the middle of the legal separation process,"" which implies that the decree of divorce or separate maintenance has not yet been finalized.

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: There is legal ambiguity in applying the statute to Alice's situation. The statute requires that for more than half of the taxable year, the principal place of abode of the child must be in the home maintained by the individual filing separately. Since Alice and Charlie only started living in the home maintained by Alice from September 16th, 2017, it is unclear if this period meets the ""more than half of the taxable year"" requirement for the year 2017. Additionally, the ambiguity exists in determining if the requirement is satisfied for the subsequent years (2018 and beyond), considering the wording of the statute and the specifics of Alice's situation.",True,True

Explanation: There is ambiguity regarding whether Alice meets the requirement of furnishing over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household, as the statute specifies. Alice furnished only 40% of the maintenance costs of the household, which is less than the required one-half (or 50%). The given fact pattern does not provide enough information to determine if there are other contributions that could allow Alice to meet the over one-half requirement when combined with the 40%. Moreover, her marital status and the fact that she lives with her son, who she is entitled to a deduction for, could introduce additional complexities in interpreting how the costs are calculated and whether any specific provisions or exceptions apply to her situation.",True,True

choice: True

A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises from the specific details of the maintenance of the household and the filing status of the tax return. The statute requires that the individual must furnish over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household during the taxable year to qualify for certain tax benefits. While it's clear Alice maintains the household for Charlie and herself since September 16th, 2017, the fact that Alice and Bob file a joint return complicates the application of the statute. Usually, filing jointly involves combining incomes and deductions, potentially affecting the assessment of who actually furnishes over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household. The statute does not provide explicit guidance on how joint filing impacts the determination of who maintains the household, leading to legal ambiguity regarding Alice's eligibility for certain deductions based on household maintenance.",True,True

A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute requires that an individual must furnish over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household during the taxable year in order to meet a certain condition. In this fact pattern, Alice and Bob maintain their home with a perfectly even split, meaning neither Alice nor Bob furnishes over one-half of the cost of maintaining their household. Therefore, strictly based on the information provided, it appears that neither Alice nor Bob would meet the condition as specified by the statute. However, because Alice and Bob file a joint return, the application of this statute may depend on how contributions to joint expenses are treated for the purposes of determining whether over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household is furnished by one party. Thus, there is legal ambiguity in how the statute's requirement applies in the context of a married couple filing jointly and sharing expenses evenly.",True,True

Explanation: ","True
Explanation: There is legal ambiguity regarding whether Bob's presence in the household for less than a month during the last six months of the taxable year (for the year 2018, given the fact pattern), means that he is considered ""not a member"" of Alice's household for the purposes of the statute. The statute requires that during the last six months of the taxable year, the individual's spouse must not be a member of such household. Since Bob lived with Alice and Charlie from September 16th, 2017, until October 10th, 2018, and considering the last six months of the taxable year 2018 (July 1st, 2018, to December 31st, 2018), Bob was present in the household for a portion of the last six months.

Alice and Charlie live in a home maintained by Alice since September 16th, 2017. Alice is entitled to a deduction for Charlie under section 151(c) for the years 2017 to 2019. Alice and Bob legally separated on February 10th, 2018. Bob lived in the same house as Alice and Charlie from September 16th, 2017 until February 10th, 2018. The current year is 2018.
choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute specifies that for the last 6 months of the taxable year, the individual's spouse must not be a member of the household for the deduction to apply. In this case, Alice and Bob legally separated on February 10th, 2018, which means Bob was a member of Alice's household for a part of the year, but not for the last 6 months of the taxable year. Therefore, whether or not Alice is entitled to the deduction for Charlie under section 151(c) hinges on the interpretation of ""last 6 months of the taxable year"" in relation to Bob's presence in the household. The given dates show Bob lived with Alice and Charlie from September 16th, 2017, until February 10th, 2018, which introduces ambiguity regarding Alice’s eligibility for the deduction for the specified tax years due to the timing of the legal separation and the definition of a household member in the statute.",True,True

The current year is 2018.
choice: True
choice: False
A: 
Explanation: ","True
Explanation: The statute refers to a spouse not being a member of the household for the last 6 months of the taxable year. In this case, Bob, who is Alice's husband, started working overseas on February 10th, 2018, and hence was not part of the household for more than half of the year if considering the taxable year ending on December 31st, 2018. However, there is ambiguity in determining membership of the household, especially if Bob maintained significant connections to the home (such as financially maintaining it or returning briefly during the period), and how such situations would be interpreted under this statute. The statute does not explicitly address the situation of spouses who live apart temporarily due to work obligations but maintain their marital relationship and financial contributions to the household.",True,True
