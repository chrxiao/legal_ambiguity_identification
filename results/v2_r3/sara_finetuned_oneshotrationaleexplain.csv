Bob did not remarry after Alice's death; however, Charlie, their child, got married to Dan on Feb 14th, 2017. The current year is 2017. The ambiguity arises from the interpretation of the phrase ""is married at the close of the taxpayer's taxable year."" Although Bob was previously married to Alice, according to the fact pattern, Bob is not currently married, but his child Charlie is. Therefore, there is legal ambiguity in determining if Bob, as the taxpayer, is considered married at the close of the taxable year due to Charlie's marriage to Dan. Hence, the answer is True.
