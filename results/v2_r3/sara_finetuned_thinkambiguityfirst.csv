- The tax owed is $17,544, plus 31% of the excess over $76,400 if the taxable income is over $76,400 but not over $127,500.

In Alice's case:
- Taxable income = $97,407

In this case, we need to establish if Bob meets this requirement based on the given timeline of living with Alice.

Since the statute mentions that the individual must have the same principal place of abode as the taxpayer for more than one-half of the taxable year, we must calculate the number of days that Bob lived with Alice from September 1st, 2015, to the end of the taxable year in 2016.

In this case, the statute specifies that an individual is not eligible for a certain benefit if they have filed a joint return with their spouse in the year that matches the taxpayer's taxable year. However, in the fact pattern, it is Alice who is the taxpayer and not Bob. Bob, Alice's son, filed a joint return with Charlie, not Alice's spouse.

In this case, Alice is the taxpayer, and the statute references filing a joint return with the individual's spouse. However, Alice is not married, and the fact pattern does not mention a spouse. Bob, Alice's son, is mentioned, but the statute does not directly apply to the relationship between Bob and Alice.

Therefore, to determine ambiguity, we need to analyze whether the statute can be interpreted to include situations where the individual is not married and whether the relationship with the son (Bob) could impact the interpretation.

However, Bob is not specifically listed in the statute, but the statute does refer to descendants of the taxpayer's siblings. This could potentially create ambiguity depending on how the term ""descendant"" is interpreted in this context. 

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, we would need to consider whether Bob, as a descendant of Alice, falls within the scope of the statute's definition.

If the adoption severs the legal relationship between Alice and Bob, then Bob would no longer qualify as a descendant of Alice under the statute. However, if the law considers the adoption as not severing the relationship between Alice and Bob, then Bob would still be considered a descendant of Alice for the purpose of the statute.

In this case, the statute specifies relationships such as son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law. In the fact pattern, Charlie is Bob's father, so Charlie is not covered by any of the relationships listed in the statute. Alice, who married Bob, is not directly related to Charlie by the relationships listed in the statute.

Therefore, by comparing the relationships in the fact pattern to those listed in the statute, we can determine if there is legal ambiguity.

Given the analysis above, the legal statute does not cover the specific relationship of a father (Charlie) to the spouse of his child (Alice). Therefore, there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern.

The statute states that in the case of domestic service in a private home, the term ""employer"" means any person who during the calendar year or the preceding calendar year paid wages in cash of $1,000 or more for such service.

In this fact pattern, Alice has paid Bob $4200 in cash for domestic service in his home in the current calendar year (2018). Bob, on the other hand, has paid Alice $3200 in cash for agricultural labor during the current calendar year (2018). It is key to establish which of them qualifies as an ""employer"" under the statute and whether all conditions of the statute are met.

The statute defines domestic service as involving work in a private home, local college club, or local chapter of a college fraternity or sorority, and the term ""employer"" applies to any person who paid wages in cash of $1,000 or more for such service during the relevant period.

The key point to consider is whether Alice had a plan established to provide for her employees' disabilities as required by the statute.

Given the fact pattern provided, we know that Alice did not have a plan in place to provide for her employees' disabilities. Therefore, the question arises as to whether the payment made to Bob upon termination due to disability qualifies as being under a plan established by the employer for his employees generally or a specific class of employees as outlined in the statute.

1. The payment is made by the employer.
2. The payment is made to a survivor or the estate of a former employee.
3. The payment is made after the calendar year in which the employee died.

Now, looking at the fact pattern, Alice, the employer, made a payment to Charlie, Bob's surviving spouse, after Bob passed away. The payment was made on December 20th, 2019, which falls in the same calendar year as Bob's death in 2019.

Therefore, based on the fact pattern and the language of the statute, there is no legal ambiguity in this case because the payment was made in the same calendar year that Bob died. This means that the payment made to Charlie would not fall under the statute provided.

In this fact pattern, Bob died in 2019, and the payment was made to Charlie, his surviving spouse, in 2020. Therefore, the key question is whether the payment made in 2020 to Bob's surviving spouse falls within the definition of the statute or not.

1. Check if the payment was made by an employer: Yes, Alice made the payment.

In this case, the statute specifically mentions that remuneration must be paid in any medium other than cash to an employee for service not in the course of the employer's trade or business. The fact pattern presents Alice, the employer, paying Bob, her employee, in cash for painting her house.

In this case, the statute mentions that a certain activity can be performed ""by the spouse of such a student."" The fact pattern involves Bob, who is the spouse of the student Alice. Bob received $3200 for services rendered to Johns Hopkins University while Alice was enrolled as a student at the same university.

The ambiguity here lies in whether the services provided by Bob to Johns Hopkins University qualify under the statute, as it does not specify the nature of the services or the relationship between the services and the student's enrollment. It is unclear whether Bob's services fall within the scope of the statute and if they are considered permissible under the law.

In this case, the statute exempts from employment certain services performed in the employ of a hospital if such services are performed by a patient of the hospital. The ambiguity arises from the fact that while Alice was a patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital during a certain period, the services for which she was later compensated were performed outside the time frame when she was officially registered as a patient.

Therefore, the potential legal ambiguity lies in whether the exemption applies only to services performed while the individual is actively a patient at the hospital or if it may also cover services performed shortly after the patient's discharge. This ambiguity could be open to interpretation and could depend on how courts have previously interpreted similar situations.

In this case, the statute states that service performed in the employ of a hospital by a patient of that hospital is exempt from certain criteria. The fact pattern describes Alice receiving payment for services performed at the hospital where she was also a patient.

To determine if there is legal ambiguity, we need to consider whether Alice's situation fits within the definition provided in the statute. In this case, Alice was both a patient and providing services at the hospital. The ambiguity lies in whether the services performed by Alice were considered to be in the ""employ of a hospital"" as stated in the statute.

The statute discusses service performed in the employ of a hospital by a patient of that hospital. In this case, Alice performed a medical experimental study at Johns Hopkins Hospital while she was a patient at the same hospital. The key question here is whether performing in a medical experimental study can be classified as a service under the statute.

Ambiguity may arise if the term ""service"" is unclear or open to interpretation. Service in this context may be interpreted narrowly to mean only formal employment duties or more broadly to encompass any activity performed for the benefit of the hospital.

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, one would need to examine how the term ""service"" has been interpreted in the relevant legal context.

While Maryland is a state within the United States and not a foreign government, the statute does not explicitly clarify whether service for a state government within the USA could be considered as ""service performed in the employ of a foreign government.""

Therefore, to determine if there is legal ambiguity, we need to consider whether the State of Maryland would be treated as a foreign government under the statute or if it only applies to foreign governments outside of the USA.

Firstly, the statute mentions ""service performed in the employ of a foreign government."" In this case, Alice is working as an employee of the Canadian Government, which qualifies as a foreign government as per the statute.

Secondly, the statute includes service ""as a consular or other officer or employee or a nondiplomatic representative"". Alice's role is not explicitly stated in the fact pattern, so we need to ascertain whether her position falls under the categories mentioned in the statute.

Therefore, to determine legal ambiguity, we need to ask whether Alice's role in the Canadian Government can be considered as service falling under the categories of ""consular or other officer or employee or a nondiplomatic representative"" as mentioned in the statute. If there is uncertainty about how Alice's role aligns with these categories, legal ambiguity exists.

In this case, the key element of the statute is service performed in the employ of a foreign government. 

In the fact pattern, Alice is employed as a janitor in the Consulate General of Canada in the U.S. The crucial question here is whether Alice's role as a janitor in the Canadian Consulate would be considered ""service performed in the employ of a foreign government"" as mentioned in the statute. 

If there is uncertainty about whether a janitorial position in a foreign consulate falls under the definition of ""service performed in the employ of a foreign government,"" then there would be legal ambiguity. In such a scenario, the application of the statute to the fact pattern would be unclear.

In the fact pattern, Alice is not a student nurse; she is a physics major. She was paid for services performed at Johns Hopkins University, not at a hospital or nurses' training school. While she was enrolled and attending classes at the university, the fact pattern does not align with the specific requirements of the statute.

Therefore, the determination of legal ambiguity in this case would involve assessing whether the scope of the statute extends to students who are not specifically enrolled in a nursing program but are attending classes at a university that has a nursing school.

2. Analyze the specific details of the fact pattern:
- Alice has paid Bob $3200 in cash for domestic service in her home in 2017.
- The statute focuses on whether the person paying for the service has paid $1,000 or more to individuals employed in domestic service.

By comparing the requirements of the statute with the specific details of the fact pattern, we can determine whether there is legal ambiguity. In this case, the fact pattern clearly states that Alice paid Bob $3200 in cash for domestic service.

In the fact pattern provided, Alice was committed to a psychiatric hospital, not a penal institution, from January 24, 2015, to May 5, 2019. The ambiguity lies in whether a psychiatric hospital qualifies as a ""penal institution"" under the statute.

2. Standard Deduction: This is a fixed dollar amount that taxpayers can deduct from their income before calculating their tax liability. Taxpayers can choose to take the standard deduction or itemize their deductions, depending on which results in a lower tax liability.

Alice is not entitled to a deduction for Bob under section 151.","To determine whether there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, we need to focus on the key elements of the statute and the facts provided. 

1. Identify the individuals involved: The statute refers to an individual for whom a deduction under section 151 is allowable to another taxpayer. In this case, Alice is the individual being considered for the basic standard deduction.

2. Verify the relationship between the individuals: The statute mentions that the deduction is allowable if another taxpayer can claim the individual as a dependent. In the fact pattern, it is stated that Alice is not entitled to a deduction for Bob under section 151. This means Bob is not a dependent of Alice.

Based on these considerations, if there is legal ambiguity in this scenario, Alice may not be considered as one for whom a deduction is allowable to another taxpayer, given that Bob is not her dependent. 

Therefore, the legal ambiguity in this case is whether Alice qualifies as an individual with respect to whom a deduction under section 151 is allowable to another taxpayer, which would affect her basic standard deduction.

Given the statute provided, which states that the amount applicable under subparagraph (A) is halved for a married individual filing separately, but does not explicitly mention the calculation for a single individual like Alice, there may be legal ambiguity in this case. The statute does not clearly outline how to calculate the applicable amount for a single individual who is not married, which could lead to different interpretations or uncertainty about the correct application of the statute.

Therefore, it is likely that there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern provided.

Fact pattern: In 2016, Alice's income was $567192. Alice is married for the year 2016 under section 7703. Alice does not file a joint return.","To determine if there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the given fact pattern, we need to carefully analyze the statutory language in relation to the specifics of the fact pattern provided. 

In this case, the statute states that the amount applicable under subparagraph (A) is to be divided by half in the case of a married individual filing a separate return. The fact pattern states that Alice is married for the year 2016 but does not specify whether she is filing as ""married filing separately"" or ""married filing jointly.""

Therefore, to ascertain legal ambiguity, we need to determine whether the statute is clear on how to treat a married individual who files separately. If the statute clearly defines the treatment of a married individual filing separately, there is no ambiguity. However, if the statute is unclear or silent on the specific treatment of a married individual filing separately, then legal ambiguity exists.

The statute specifies that the section does not apply to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026. In the fact pattern, the year mentioned is 2014.

We need to assess if there is any ambiguity about whether the statute applies to the year 2014, given that it falls before the cutoff date of December 31, 2017. Since the statute explicitly mentions that it does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and the fact pattern occurs in 2014, it is clear that the statute does not apply to the year 2014.

2. In the fact pattern, Alice and Bob got married on April 5th, 2012, and Bob died on September 16th, 2017. The current year is 2018.

To determine legal ambiguity, we need to consider the timing of Bob's death in relation to the applicable tax year. In this case, Bob died in 2017, and the determination of his marital status should be made at the time of his death according to the statute. Since the current year is 2018, the determination should be based on Bob's marital status at the time of his death in 2017.

In the fact pattern provided, the current year is 2012, and Bob died in 2017.

First, we need to determine the legal status of Alice and Bob. While they are in the process of legal separation, as per the fact pattern, the key question is whether this legal separation is considered under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance as mentioned in the statute.

The key point of analysis would be whether being ""legally separated under a decree of divorce"" means that once the divorce is finalized and the individuals are legally divorced, they are no longer considered married, or if it refers to the period during which the divorce is being processed. The ambiguity arises from the interpretation of the phrase ""legally separated"" and whether it includes the finalized divorce or only the period leading up to the final divorce decree.
