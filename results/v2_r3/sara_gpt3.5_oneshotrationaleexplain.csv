Explanation: ","Statute: 
(i) by a student who is enrolled and is regularly attending classes at such school, college, or university

Fact pattern: Alice was paid $3200 in 2017 for services performed for Johns Hopkins University. Alice was enrolled at Johns Hopkins University from August 29, 2015 to May 30th, 2019. Alice mostly skips class.

The statute requires that the student be enrolled and regularly attending classes at the school, college, or university. In this fact pattern, Alice is enrolled at Johns Hopkins University, but it is mentioned that she mostly skips classes. The phrase ""regularly attending classes"" could be interpreted in different ways - one might argue that merely being enrolled constitutes ""regular attendance,"" while others might argue that skipping class does not meet the requirement. Therefore, there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to this fact pattern. Hence, the answer is True.

Statute: 
(3) Age requirements
For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), an individual meets the requirements of this paragraph if such individual is younger than the taxpayer claiming such individual as a qualifying child and is less than 25 years old at the end of the taxable year.

Fact pattern: Alice was born January 10th, 1992. Bob was born January 31st, 1984. Alice became Bob's foster parent on March 4th, 2018. The current year is 2019.

Based on the provided statute, an individual needs to be younger than the taxpayer claiming them as a qualifying child and be less than 25 years old at the end of the taxable year to meet the requirements. In this fact pattern, Alice was born on January 10th, 1992, making her 27 years old in 2019. Bob was born on January 31st, 1984, making him older than Alice. Therefore, as Alice is not younger than Bob and is older than 25 years old, she does not meet the age requirements outlined in the statute. Therefore, there is no legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to this fact pattern. The answer is False.",False,True

Explanation: In this fact pattern, although Bob maintained the home where he and Charlie lived, the statute requires that the individual maintaining the home must maintain it as their principal place of abode for over half of the taxable year.

Response: True

Explanation: There is legal ambiguity in this application because while Alice is enrolled and attending classes at the nurses' training school, she is working as an administrative assistant, not a student nurse. The statute specifically mentions service performed as a student nurse, and it does not explicitly include other types of work within its scope. Therefore, there is legal ambiguity in this scenario.

Response: False

Explanation: In this case, there is no legal ambiguity because the fact pattern clearly states that Alice did not have a plan established to provide for her employees' disabilities.

Choice: False

Explanation: In this case, there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern. Although Alice was enrolled at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, the fact pattern indicates she was working as an administrative assistant and not as a student nurse.

Choice: True

Explanation: The statute specifies that the individual must furnish over one-half of the cost of maintaining the household during the taxable year to qualify for the deduction. In this case, both Alice and Charlie are contributing equally to the cost of maintaining the household, so it is not clear if Alice meets the requirement stated in the statute.

Explanation: ","Statute:         (5) Limitation on basic standard deduction in the case of certain dependents 

In the situation provided in the fact pattern, there is legal ambiguity.

In this fact pattern, Alice and Bob got married on Feb 3rd, 2017, which is in the same year as her taxable year. Bob earned only $10 in 2017.
