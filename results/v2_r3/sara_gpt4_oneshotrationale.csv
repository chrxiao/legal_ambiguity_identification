Explanation: During the current year, Alice and Bob are not yet legally separated. 

Statute:     (1) In general <br>  <br>    An individual shall be considered a head of a household if, and only if, such individual is not married at the close of his taxable year, is not a surviving spouse (as defined in subsection (a)), and either- <br>     For purposes of this paragraph, an individual shall be considered as maintaining a household only if over half of the cost of maintaining the household during the taxable year is furnished by such individual.
Fact pattern: Alice and Bob got married on Feb 3rd, 1992. Alice died on July 9th, 2014.

Bob is entitled to a deduction for Charlie under section 151(c) for the years 2015 to 2019. The current year is 2016.
choice: True
choice: False
A: ","False
Explanation: In the current year, 2016, Bob is a widower (surviving spouse) but he also maintains a household for himself and his dependent son, Charlie. Since the statute specifies conditions for being considered a head of a household excluding those who are surviving spouses, and given the fact Bob is a surviving spouse, it might seem ambiguous. However, the ambiguity is resolved because Bob does meet the conditions of maintaining a household for himself and his dependent, thereby meeting the conditions set out in the law, assuming there aren't additional legal definitions or exceptions not provided in the given statute and fact pattern. The key ambiguity would potentially lie in the interpretation of surviving spouse exclusion, but the conditions outlined for being considered a head of a household (not married at the close of his taxable year and furnishing over half the cost of maintaining the household) are met by Bob for the years 2015 to 2019.",False,False
