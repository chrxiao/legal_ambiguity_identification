Ambiguity can arise from the wording of the statute itself or from its application to specific circumstances.

Given this definition, we need to ascertain whether there is ambiguity in the provided statute when applied to the fact pattern.

**Statute**:
The statute in question outlines the protection of property, stating everyone has the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions unless deprivation is in the public interest and according to law and international principles. It also allows states to enforce laws deemed necessary to control property use, ensure tax payment, or impose penalties.

**Fact Pattern**:
The fact pattern revolves around an individual's (the applicant) claim for payment for services provided, which was acknowledged and partially settled through legal processes, including insolvency proceedings of a debtor company, and subsequent judicial decisions. The applicant's contention is regarding the partial payment received (10% of the total debt).

Considering the definition of ambiguity:

- The statute’s provision about the ""peaceful enjoyment of his possessions"" and the exceptions to deprivation of possessions might not directly reflect on the fact pattern's specifics regarding the insolvency proceedings and the claim for unpaid services.
- The statute speaks to property rights but does not clearly define what constitutes “public interest” or the exact ""conditions provided for by law"" in cases like insolvency, which involves settling debts and claims against a company's remaining assets.
- The ambiguity question could arise on whether the applicant's right to full compensation for his services falls under these protected property rights, especially when considered against the backdrop of insolvency laws where claims often result in partial payments.

**True or False Assessment**:
Given the complexity of how the statute's broader provisions on property protection apply to the specific scenario of insolvency proceedings and debt repayment to a service provider, and considering the statute does not detail how such cases should be handled specifically, **True**; there is ambiguity in how the statute applies to the described fact pattern.",TRUE,"statute, appl",TRUE,TRUE,both
