Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Nicoreni. 6.  In January 2012 the applicant had an agreement with a person (""X"") according to which he promised to help him apply for a Spanish visa at the Spanish consulate in Moscow. They were to travel to Moscow by train, however, X did not show up at the train station at the time of leaving and the applicant left for Moscow alone with the money he had previously obtained from X in the amount of 520 euros. He did not return to Moldova until October 2015. 7.  In the meantime X lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant accusing him of fraud. Criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant in March 2012 on the basis of that complaint. 8.  Since the prosecutor in charge of the case could not locate the applicant, he applied to an investigating judge for a detention warrant in respect of the applicant for a period of thirty days. The prosecutor argued in support of the remand that the applicant had been hiding from the investigating authorities. 9.  On 8 February 2013 the Râșcani District Court ordered the applicant's remand in custody for a period of thirty days. In support of its decision, the court argued that the applicant had been absconding from the investigating authorities and that he could hinder the investigation and influence witnesses. 10.  On 9 October 2015 the applicant returned to Moldova from the Russian Federation. At the border he was informed that he was being wanted by the police and that he had to present himself at the Râșcani Police Station. The applicant telephoned the police station and agreed to come on 13 October 2015. 11.  On 13 October 2015 the applicant went to the Râșcani Police Station where he was immediately arrested and placed in detention. 12.  On 15 October 2015 the applicant appealed against the order of 8 February 2013. He argued, inter alia, that he had not been aware of the criminal investigation against himself and that he had learned about it upon his return to Moldova. Moreover, after learning about the investigation he had immediately contacted the Police Station and presented himself there. He also submitted that there were no reasons to believe that he would abscond or interfere with the investigation. 13.  On 2 November 2015 the Chișinău Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. It did not give an answer to the applicant's argument that he had not been aware of the criminal investigation against him. 14.  The applicant's detention was prolonged on several other occasions until 16 March 2016 on identical grounds and all his appeals were dismissed. 15.  In the meantime the applicant was detained in Prison no. 13. According to him, he was detained in an overcrowded cell; the cell was equipped with a squat toilet which was not properly separated; the food was insufficient and of poor quality; he could have only one hour of outside exercise per day and only one shower per week. 16.  By a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of 12 July 2017 the applicant was convicted of fraud and given a suspended sentence of four years imprisonment.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Bijela, Montenegro. 5.  On 1 March 2012 the Herceg Novi First Instance Court rendered a judgment in favour of the applicant and ordered the applicant's employer ""Vektra Boka"" AD Herceg Novi (hereinafter ""the debtor"") to carry out a re‑allocation of plots for the construction of apartments. This judgment became final on 21 December 2012. 6.

The administrative proceedings are still pending. 15.  On an unspecified day in 2003, the applicant instituted separate civil proceedings against the debtor, as his former employer, seeking reinstatement and damages. Following three remittals, on 3 March 2014 the Herceg Novi First Instance Court rendered a judgment in the applicant's favour. 16.  On 22 September 2015 the High Court upheld this judgment on the merits, but quashed it as regards the costs. 17.  On 31 October 2016 the Herceg Novi First Instance Court transferred the case to the Commercial Court for further action due to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor. 18.  On 22 February 2017 the Commercial Court ruled partly in favour of the applicant regarding the costs. 19.

Explanation: The fact pattern presents ambiguity regarding whether the applicant received a fair trial within a reasonable time, as required by Article 6 of the statute. The enforcement of the judgment in the applicant's favor has faced significant delays, with several transfers of the case between courts and the suspension of enforcement due to insolvency proceedings. Additionally, the administrative proceedings initiated by the applicant have also faced terminations and objections being rejected.

Prohibition of torture 

No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicants were born in 1965 and 1954 respectively and live in Bucharest. 5.  Both applicants were ill-treated and injured on 21 December 1989 during the events which led to the fall of the communist regime in Bucharest. The first applicant suffered injuries that needed eight days of medical care and the second applicant was beaten by militia forces on the same occasion. 6.  In 1990 the military prosecutor's office opened ex officio investigations into the illegal detention, ill-treatment and injury suffered by the applicants and other participants in the events of December 1989 in respect of several offences as mentioned below. The main criminal investigation was recorded in file no. 97/P/1990 (current no. 11/P/2014). 7.  In the meantime, an ex officio investigation concerning the offences of illegal deprivation of liberty, illegal arrest and abusive investigation of a large number of persons, including the applicants, culminated in the referral to court and subsequent conviction of senior military and public officials by a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 10 May 1991, which became final on 14 November 1991. The injured parties, including the applicants, did not participate in that procedure, as the Government acknowledged. 8.  As regards the offence of abusive conduct, the military prosecutor's office decided on 9 March 1994 (in respect of the first applicant) and 28 October 1994 (in respect of the second applicant) not to open a separate ex officio investigation on the grounds that the offence of abusive conduct fell under a subsequently enacted amnesty law; that decision was communicated only to the second applicant on 4 October 2001. No decision was adopted in respect of the applicants' injury. 9.  Further, without a formal decision to overturn the decisions issued by the military prosecutor's office (see paragraph 8 above) and to reopen the applicants' respective cases, in the main criminal investigation, the prosecutor heard the applicants who reiterated their complaints regarding the offences of illegal deprivation of liberty and homicide as an attempt raised on account of their ill-treatment and injury during the events of December 1989. Thus, the first applicant requested on 5 January 2005 and on 4 August 2008 to participate in these proceedings as a civil party and for the investigation of his case to be pursued by the military prosecutor's office. In the main criminal investigation, the second applicant gave a statement on 4 October 2001 and lodged a civil claim on 17 May 2005, asking for the punishment of those responsible. 10.  The relevant procedural steps taken in the main criminal investigation were described in Association ""21 December 1989"" and Others v. Romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 May 2011) and Anamaria‑Loredana Orășanu and Others v. Romania ([Committee] (nos. 43629/13 and 74 others, §§ 10‑11, 7 November 2017). 11.  On 14 October 2015, as regards the second applicant, the military prosecutor's office issued a decision only in respect of the offence of instigation to illegal deprivation of liberty by closing the main criminal investigation on the grounds of res judicata in relation to the Supreme Court of Justice's decision of 10 May 1991, failing to decide the offence of homicide as an attempt or her injury, as complained of (see paragraph 7 above). No decision was taken in respect of the first applicant. 12.  Although the parties have not communicated any information regarding the lodging of an appeal against this decision, it can be seen from the military prosecutor's office website that it was subsequently quashed. Thus, on 1 November 2016 the military prosecutor's office ordered the initiation in rem of a criminal investigation regarding the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same circumstances of fact. To date, the main criminal investigation is still ongoing.

2. Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him. 

3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.

Fact pattern: 4.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 5.  The applicant was born in Baku, Azerbaijan, in 1992 and came to Russia in 2003, together with his mother and grandmother. He graduated from a secondary school and a vocational training college in St Petersburg. He has no identity documents. 6.  On 7 February 2014 the Kirovskiy District Court in St Petersburg found the applicant guilty of illegally residing in Russia, which was an offence Article 18.8 § 3 of the Code of Administrative Offences, imposed a fine on him and ordered his administrative removal from Russia. The judgment described him as a ""native"" (уроженец) and a national of Azerbaijan. Pending his removal, the applicant was to be detained in the special facility for the detention of aliens (СУВСИГ УФМС по СПб и ЛО) located in Krasnoye Selo in the Leningrad Region. 7.  On 12 February 2014 the Federal Migration Service requested the Consulate General of Azerbaijan in St Petersburg to submit information about the applicant's nationality. Replying to that inquiry, on 14 April 2014 the Consulate confirmed that the applicant was not a national of that State. 8.  On 19 May 2014 a bailiff asked the District Court in St Petersburg to discontinue the enforcement proceedings because the applicant could not be issued with travel documents or removed from Russia. 9.  By a judgment of 17 July 2014, as upheld on appeal on 30 October 2014, the St Petersburg courts refused to discontinue the proceedings, finding that the bailiff had not shown that she had taken sufficient measures to secure the applicant's removal. 10.  On 7 August 2014 counsel for the applicant asked the St Petersburg City Court to review the Kirovskiy District Court's judgment by way of supervisory review, to annul the sanction of administrative removal and to release the applicant. Counsel pleaded in particular that the applicant's removal was not a realistic prospect and that his continued detention could only be justified if deportation proceedings were genuinely in progress. On 25 November 2014 a deputy president of the City Court acceded to her request. Noting that the applicant was not an Azerbaijani national, the judge found that his removal was not feasible and that his detention was likely to become indefinite. He amended the judgment, replacing the removal with the requirement to leave Russia voluntarily under control. 11.  On 27 November 2014 the applicant was released. 12.  The applicant described his conditions of detention as follows. From 7 to 20 February 2014 he shared Cell 307 measuring 17 square metres with ten other detainees. It was not furnished, inmates unrolled mattresses for the night. From 20 February to 5 May 2014 he was held in a smaller, seven‑square-metre cell (Cell 310), together with five or six persons. Two-tier bunk beds were brought in only in late April 2014. From 5 May to 27 November 2014 he was in Cell 309 measuring seventeen square metres. Initially it had accommodated twelve persons but their number rose to seventeen in November when they started renovating the cells on the seventh and eighth floors of the facility. Detainees had to remain within the floor on which their cell was located; they could not go outside or to other floors. Outdoor exercise was limited to a fifteen-minute walk once a week because there was not enough staff to supervise the detainees. The facility did not have a library, board games, radio or workshop, or offer any other meaningful activities.

Explanation: The provided fact pattern specifically discusses the applicant's detention related to his illegal residency in Russia, which follows under Article 5's allowable conditions for deprivation of liberty, particularly focusing on (f) ""the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorized entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition."" However, this detention should have been procedural, including providing reasons for arrest (as per Article 5 section 2), presenting him promptly before a judicial authority, and ensuring his detention's review for lawfulness (sections 3 and 4). The final judgment that led to his release acknowledged that his continued detention was inappropriate given the impracticality of his deportation. Thus, while the initial grounds for detention may align with the statute, the implementation, particularly the prolonged nature and conditions of detention without a feasible deportation plan, raises concerns. However, these concerns relate more to the conduct and conditions of detention and the procedural rights under Article 5, rather than the ambiguity about the legality of detention per the provided conditions. Therefore, considering the statute's provisions and the detention's initial grounds, there is no ambiguity about the statute's applicability; the ambiguity might lie in the detention's management and conditions.",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,1,"While it depends on the definition of ""speedy,"" it appears that the lawfulness of the applicant's detention was not decided speedily, as it took more than 3 months.",FALSE,N/A,incorrect concl,FALSE

Fact pattern: 4.  Between 1986 and 1987 the applicants took part in the clean-up operation at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site. They were subsequently registered disabled and became entitled to various social benefits and compensation paid on a regular basis. 5.  Considering these benefits insufficient, the applicants together with other 482 people, sued the Russian Ministry of Finance for additional compensation corresponding to non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of their participation in the operation. 6.  On different dates in January and April 2011 the Nalchik Town Court of Kabardino-Balkaria (""the Town Court"") allowed their claims in part and awarded each claimant, including the applicants, compensation ranging between 1,200,000 Russian roubles (RUB) and RUB 1,600,000 for non‑pecuniary damage. 7.  No appeals were lodged against these judgments within the statutory ten-day time-limit. The judgments became final but have never been executed. 8.  On different dates the Town Court granted the defendant authority's request to extend the time-limit for appeal on the grounds that the authorities had not received a copy of the judgment in due course. Subsequently the regional Supreme Court quashed the judgments delivered in the applicants' favour on the grounds that they had been based on retrospective application of the law.

Explanation: The fact pattern involving the confinement of the applicant in a metal cage during the trial, without a desk and only a wooden bench, making it impossible for him to take notes, along with the presence of armed guards and restricted communication with his lawyer, could potentially constitute inhuman or degrading treatment. This treatment during the court proceedings appears to violate Article 3 of the Prohibition of Torture, as it likely degraded the applicant’s dignity and subjected him to a level of discomfort and humiliation beyond what is considered acceptable in the context of detention and trial.

Protection of property 

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. 

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Nizhniy Novgorod. 6.  On 25 October 2002 the Military Court of the Vladikavkaz Garrison (""the Military Court"") ordered, inter alia, the head of the respondent military institute to re-calculate the period of the applicant's service, applying the favourable terms of such calculation for a specified period of service. The applicant was also awarded some additional allowances and payments for certain periods. 7.  The judgment came into force on 5 November 2002. 8.  On 3 March 2003 the Military Court issued a writ of execution. On 4 August 2003 the bailiffs' service instituted the enforcement proceedings. 9.  On 19 September 2003 the enforcement proceedings were terminated and the writ of execution was returned to the applicant, as the debt could not be recovered. 10.  On 13 November 2003 the head of the respondent military institute issued Order No. 463 requiring to make payments in accordance with the judgment of 25 October 2002. However, no calculations or payments were made at that time. 11.  On 4 February 2005 the applicant submitted the writ of execution to the Federal Treasury. 12.  On 18 May 2005 the writ was returned to the applicant on the ground that the judgment obliged an official of an organisation to take certain actions rather than ordered to recover payments from a budgetary organisation. Thus, the writ of execution was to be submitted to the bailiffs' service. 13.  On an unspecified date in 2005 the applicant submitted the writ of execution to the bailiffs' service. 14.  On 14 April 2006 the writ of execution was returned to the applicant from the bailiffs' service without enforcement. The bailiffs explained that for the applicant to be able to receive the payments under the judgment, he should obtain a writ of execution stating the sum of the debt to be recovered. After that, the writ could be submitted to the Federal Treasury for enforcement. 15.  In 2005 in accordance with Order No. 463, the defendant military institute calculated the amounts due to the applicant as follows: the compensation for the supplementary ration for the period from October 1998 until March 2000 –11,341.85 Russian roubles (RUB); allowance for special regime of the service in 1998-2002 – RUB 2,720.1; and special allowance – RUB 327,000.

Right to life 

1. Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law. 

2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary: 
(a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence; 
(b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained; 
(c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Nizhniy Novgorod. 5.  On 25 July 2002 the applicant's 51-year-old brother Aleksandr Alekseyvich Anoshin was murdered by a policeman in the alcohol recovery centre of the Sovietsky District Police Department of Nizhniy Novgorod (медицинский вытрезвитель при Советском РУВД г. Нижнего Новгорода). 6.  Earlier that day, at about 7 p.m., he was stopped in the street by a police patrol as he was staggering home after having drinks with workmates. He was driven to the centre and left alone on a bed in a recovery room, as centre staff sat down to a game of cards nearby. One hour later Mr Anoshin started banging on the door and asking to be let out. Officer M., who together with his partner K. had just returned from patrol duty, got annoyed at the disruption, pushed Mr Anoshin away from the door and demanded that he calm down. Mr Anoshin fell on the bed and his head slammed against the wall. He then got to his feet and stepped towards the officer. Officer M. punched the applicant's brother in the head and chest five times, and strangled him until he was unconscious using a squared piece of a broken wooden chair. M. laid Mr Anoshin down on the bed, and walked out. Officer An. watched this scene from the doorway. 7.  At 10 p.m. the applicant's brother died of asphyxia. 8.  On 3 August 2002 the Prosecutor's Office of the Sovietsky District opened a criminal investigation into the death. The investigation lasted four years and was handled in turn by at least six different investigators. They inspected the scene, conducted witness interviews, commissioned forensic reports, and staged reconstructions. 9.  The centre staff initially testified that they had found the applicant's brother unwell in his bed, but then changed their story, saying that they had seen him hang himself using a bed sheet tied to the bars of his cell window. The forensic reports (on the cause of death, the nature of the injuries, the origin of blood on the wall and the presence of metallic traces on the sheet) refuted the hanging hypothesis, pointed to a violent death and incriminated the centre staff. However, the investigation was put on hold thirteen times because no credible suspect had been identified. 10.  In March 2006 M. was interviewed for the first time. 11.  By August 2006 the case against him had gone to trial. 12.  On 1 August 2008 the Sovietsky District Court of Nizhniy Novgorod convicted M. of murder and violent abuse of official power and sentenced him to fourteen years' imprisonment and a three-year ban from police service. Neglect-of-duty charges brought against his two co‑defendants (Officers An. and Ag.) were dropped as time-barred. 13.  At the trial, M. was directly incriminated by An., Ag., and K. Officers An. and Ag. confessed that the suicide story had been a cover-up condoned by commanders of Sovietsky Police Department. 14.  On 14 November 2008 the Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Court upheld the sentence. 15.  The applicant and three of her brother's four children each claimed from the State 3,000,000 Russian roubles (RUB – approximately 69,000 euros (EUR)) for emotional distress caused by the crime. On 25 May 2009 the Sovietsky District Court awarded RUB 150,000 (approximately EUR 3,400) to each claimant. 16.  On 14 August 2009 the Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Court upheld that decision.

Explanation: The case depicted involves a deprivation of life by a state official (a police officer) under circumstances that are clearly not covered by the exceptions outlined in Article 2 (such as self-defense, lawful arrest, or quelling a riot). Therefore, it is a straightforward application of the right to life as protected under Article 2, and the actions taken by the police officer and the initial police response do not align with the provisions and protections of Article 2. The case shows a clear violation of the right to life, but the lack of immediate and adequate response from the authorities to investigate and address the violation introduces ambiguity regarding the application of the statute, particularly about the effectiveness of the protection of the right to life and accountability for its violation.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Oslo, Norway. 5.  On 26 April 2000 criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant and one other person in connection with a traffic accident which had resulted in death of a child. 6.  On 25 February 2003 the Court of First Instance in Podgorica convicted the applicant for endangering public traffic and sentenced him and his co-accused to one year and six months' imprisonment. 7.  On an unspecified date in 2006 the High Court in Podgorica quashed this judgment and remitted case back to the Court of First Instance. 8.  On 18 April 2007 the Court of First Instance adopted a new judgment and again convicted the applicant and his co-accused. But the court reduced the sentence to one year and four months' imprisonment. 9.  On 13 November 2009 the High Court further reduced the sentence of the applicant's co-accused, but upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance in respect of the applicant. 10.  The applicant's subsequent appeal against the judgment of the High Court was rejected on 14 June 2010. 11.  Following that rejection, on an unspecified date in 2010, the applicant lodged a further appeal on points of law (zahtjev za ispitivanje zakonitosti pravosnažne presude) with the Supreme Court. 12.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1935 and lives in the town of Snizhne, Donetsk region. 5.  On 14 January 2004 the applicant's son, born in 1967, was found dead in the applicant's barn. On the same day police officers inspected the scene and reported that the man had committed suicide by hanging. 6.  On 24 January 2004 the investigator of the Snizhne Prosecutor's Office, following the pre-investigation inquiries, refused to initiate criminal proceedings on the grounds that no elements of a crime had been established in relation to the death of the applicant's son. 7.  On 11 February 2004, following a forensic medical examination, an expert concluded that the applicant's son's death had been caused by strangulation by a loop of rope, possibly as a result of the applicant's son's body weight pulling against the rope. The body displayed no other injuries. 8.  On 5 April 2005 the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor's Office quashed the decision of 24 January 2004 (see paragraph 6 above) as premature and unfounded, finding that further pre-investigation inquiries were necessary given that the possible reasons for suicide had not been examined, and other relatives as well as acquaintances of the deceased had not been questioned either. Numerous investigating instructions were given. 9.  In the course of further pre-investigation inquiries, between 2005 and 2012, the investigators took measures to establish the circumstances of the applicant's son's death. They questioned various persons, and ordered numerous additional medical examinations of the corpse of the deceased. At a certain point medical experts noted that the applicant's son's body had numerous fractures. The experts opined that all those fractures had been inflicted after the applicant's son's death, possibly during the exhumation of the body. The applicant's husband informed the authorities that when he had seen his dead son in the barn, the corpse of his son had been in a sitting position and the rope loop had not been tightened. The applicant argued that it had not been suicide but a violent murder. She advanced different theories, suspecting notably: police security guards who had allegedly taken the applicant's son from a local bar, following which he had been found dead; a local police officer who had engaged in a dispute with the applicant's son; a woman who had been employed by the applicant's son in his textile business and her husband; the applicant's son's brothers-in-law; a business partner of the applicant's son; and people from a local gambling club (the applicant's son had been engaged in transporting money from the club to another town). 10.  On 25 April 2005, 26 March 2006, 20 August 2008, 17 February and 12 December 2011, 15 February 2012 and 17 September 2012, following the pre-investigation inquiries, the investigators refused to initiate criminal proceedings on the grounds that no elements of a crime had been established. Those decisions were quashed as unsubstantiated by the supervising authorities, which found that further investigative measures were necessary. Numerous investigating instructions were given. 11.  On 7 December 2012 the applicant, relying on the new Code of Criminal Procedure of 2012, requested that an investigation be opened in respect of the alleged murder of her son. On the same day criminal proceedings were instituted. 12.  On 24 December 2012, 22 July and 30 September 2013 the criminal proceedings were terminated because no elements of a crime could be established. Those decisions were quashed by the supervising authorities as unsubstantiated and further investigations were ordered. In particular, on 5 December 2013 the Snizhne Town Court quashed the decision of 30 September 2013 after finding that the investigation had not been thorough and comprehensive. The court noted the theory of the possible involvement of the local police had not been properly examined, the role of the applicant's son's brother-in-law had not been clarified even though he might have been the first to find the dead body, the applicant had not been questioned on all the issues which were relevant to the case, and the evidence relating to the applicant's son's suicidal tendencies had not been assessed. 13.

Explanation: The fact pattern presents ambiguity regarding whether the right to life was protected under the circumstances of the applicant's son's death. The repeated refusals to initiate criminal proceedings, decisions being quashed as unsubstantiated, and the extended duration of the investigation without a conclusive outcome suggest uncertainty and potential failure in effectively investigating the possible wrongful death. The ambiguity also extends to whether the death was a result of a crime or suicide, and if the investigators' actions (or lack thereof) could be considered within the bounds of ""absolutely necessary"" force or actions as outlined in the statute. This prolonged and seemingly inconclusive investigation process raises questions about the application of the right to life statuary provisions in this case.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2,"The applicant's son was deprived of his life, but ostensibly through his own doing.

Prohibition of torture 

No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1961 and is currently detained in Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel near Sofia. 5.  In a final judgment of 23 February 2009, the applicant was convicted of murder and sentenced to twelve years' imprisonment. On 6 April 2009 he entered Sofia Prison to serve his sentence. He did not say anything about the conditions of his detention there. 6.  On 21 August 2009 he was transferred to Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel, a closed-type prison hostel. 7.  On 26 August 2009 the serving of his sentence of imprisonment was interrupted in order for him to take care of his elderly mother, who had undergone hip-replacement surgery in July 2009. The interruption came to an end on 26 October 2009, and the applicant was again placed in Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel. 8.  From 26 October 2009 until 28 October 2010 the applicant was placed in group no. 72. According to him, the group was housed in several cabins with cement floors. The cells were heated with wooden and coal stoves. They were damp and had many of their windows broken and doors shattered. Each cell had between thirty and thirty-five square metres of floor space and housed between sixteen and twenty-two inmates – that is, provided less than two square metres per inmate –, and had one sink and one toilet with a shower. According to the Government, the cell measured between thirty-five and forty square metres and housed around twelve inmates. 9.  The applicant further said that cold water was only available between 6 and 8 a.m. and 6 and 8 p.m., and hot water was only available between 8 and 9 a.m. and 7 and 8 p.m. Hygienic and sanitary materials were not regularly provided. There was no canteen or dedicated eating space, and no cutlery. As a result of those conditions – mainly the cold and the humidity –he had developed arthritis of both knees. 10.  On 28 October 2010 the applicant was transferred to group no. 6. He was placed in a cell which he shared with three to four other inmates. He also started working in the hostel's canteen and had his meals there. According to the Government, the applicant had to share a cell with two to three inmates. The cell was heated with electricity and there were no water supply restrictions. The door and the windows were in good condition. 11.  After the applicant's prison regime was changed to a more lenient one, on 19 November 2014 he was placed in a cell outside the guarded area of the hostel. The Government submitted that his cell had its own sanitary facilities and that no water supply restrictions existed. 12.  According to the applicant, material conditions in the cells in which he was placed after 28 October 2010 were significantly better in terms of heating, lighting and hygiene, and were satisfactory. Food was also of good quality. Taking a shower, however, was only possible after 10 p.m. due to low water pressure. 13.  Lastly, the applicant alleged that health care in custody was inadequate, with no qualified doctors but only a dentist working on site, and no provision of medicines at reduced prices, as available to people out of prison. 14.  Kremikovtsi Prison is a closed-type prison hostel attached to Sofia Prison. 15.  According to the 2010 report of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (""the CPT"") on the visit to Bulgaria from 15 to 19 December 2008, in 2008 the number of the inmates detained in that facility was 622. 16.  In its 2008 report The Prisons in Bulgaria the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee noted poor material conditions, overcrowding and problems with health care in closed-types prison hostels. According to the same report in 2007 the health-care staff in Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel consisted only of a dentist and a feldsher. 17.  According to information provided by the Government to the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers, in December 2013 the official capacity of the prison hostel was 426, whereas the actual number of inmates housed there was 493 (see Neshkov and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 36925/10 and 5 others, § 143, 27 January 2015). 18.  In the 2012 report and 2016 report adopted under the national preventive mechanism, the Ombudsman of Bulgaria recommended that Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel be closed due to severe overcrowding, poor hygiene and unsanitary living conditions.

Fact pattern: 6.  The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan. 7.  In 1990 the applicant started living with Ms T.K. 8.  In 1991 and 1992 they had two daughters, Kr. (born on 1 July 1991) and K. (born on 13 July 1992). The applicant did not register his paternity. 9.  In 2002 the applicant and T.K. separated. Both girls continued living with the applicant. 10.  In 2004 T.K. married Yu.K. 11.  In May 2004 Yu.K. registered his paternity in respect of Kr. and K. However, the girls still remained living with the applicant. 12.  In July 2007 K. stopped attending school, frequently ran away from home and exhibited delinquent behaviour. She allegedly stole her mother's jewellery. 13.  In December 2007, following an application by T.K., K. was placed in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders. 14.  On 18 February 2008 the Kirovskiy District Court of Makhachkala (""the District Court""), sitting in a single-judge formation composed of Judge I., granted an application lodged by the administration of the Kirovskiy District of Makhachkala to place K. in a closed educational institution for minors for two years and five months. In taking this decision the District Court relied on the following circumstances: K.'s not attending school, running away from home, vagabonding and leading an anti-social and immoral lifestyle, as well as unsuccessful attempts to discipline K. and her being detained in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders. 15.  On an unspecified date shortly afterwards K. was placed in a closed educational institution for minors in the town of Pokrov, Vladimir Region, some 2,500 km from her home town of Makhachkala. According to the applicant, his daughter's correspondence with him was subjected to censorship by the facility's administration. 16.  In the meantime, the applicant brought proceedings seeking the establishment of his paternity vis-à-vis Kr. and K. 17.  On 9 April 2008 the District Court established the applicant's paternity in respect of Kr. and K. and annuled the registration of Yu.K. as the girls' father. 18.  At the applicant's request, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Dagestan applied to the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Dagestan for a supervisory review of the decision of 18 February 2008. 19.  The present application was already pending before the European Court of Human Rights when, on 7 August 2008, the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Dagestan, by way of a supervisory review, quashed the decision of 18 February 2008 as unlawful and unjustified, and discontinued the proceedings. The court held, in particular, that in violation of the procedure established by the Federal Law on Basic Measures for Preventing Child Neglect and Delinquency of Minors, no. 120-FZ of 24 June 1999 (""the Minors Act""), the District Court had decided to place K. in a closed educational institution for minors in the absence of a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings or a decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the latter, and without her having undergone a prior medical examination. 20.  On 30 September 2008 K. was released from the closed educational institution for minors and returned home.

Explanation: There is ambiguity in this fact pattern concerning the right to respect for private and family life versus the state's interference to address issues of public safety, disorder, or the protection of health or morals, particularly in relation to a minor's behavior. The fact pattern demonstrates a conflict between the applicant's right to respect for his family life and the state's interference, through court orders and placement of his daughter in a closed educational institution far from home, purportedly for her own safety and moral upbringing. Additionally, the issue of paternity and its late establishment adds to the complexity of whether the state's actions were proportionate and necessary in this case.

Fact pattern: 6.  The applicant was born in 1975 and is detained in Tekirdağ. 7.  On 9 September 1995 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. 8.  On the same day the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court prolonged the applicant's detention in police custody for a period of up to 15 days. 9.  On 13 September 1995 the applicant's statements were taken by the police in the absence of a lawyer. The applicant confessed to being a member of an illegal organisation and having been involved in a murder. 10.  On 14 September 1995 the applicant participated in a reconstruction of the events (yer gösterme) with another suspect K.A., organised by the police in the absence of a lawyer. According to a report, drafted by police officers and signed by the applicant and K.A., both of the accused gave the details of the murder which they had committed. 11.  On 22 September 1995 the applicant was examined by a doctor from the Istanbul Forensic Institute. A collective medical report was drawn up in respect of the applicant and five other suspects. According to the report, there were no traces of ill-treatment on the applicant's body. 12.  On 22 September 1995 the applicant was heard by a public prosecutor and an investigating judge respectively. In his statements to the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, the applicant denied his police statements alleging that they had been taken under duress. Following his questioning, the investigating judge ordered the applicant's detention on remand. 13.  On 9 October 1995 a public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment with that court, charging the applicant with attempting to undermine the constitutional order, an offence prescribed by Article 146 § 1 of the former Criminal Code. 14.  On 7 December 1995 the applicant was heard by the trial court during the first hearing in the presence of his lawyer. The applicant denied all the charges against him and stated that his statements at the police had been taken under duress. 15.  In the meantime, State Security Courts were abolished by Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004. Accordingly, the case was transferred to Istanbul Assize Court. 16.  On 13 September 2007, relying on, inter alia, the applicant's and his co-accused K. A.'s statements to the police, the Istanbul Assize Court held that the applicant had committed the offence under Article 146 § 1 of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to life-imprisonment. 17.  On an unknown date the applicant's lawyer appealed against the judgment of 13 September 2007. 18.  On 1 December 2008 the Court of Cassation upheld the above judgment.

Fact pattern: 4. The applicant lives in Kutina. 5.  From 1 January 2001 the applicant concluded several consecutive fixed-duration contracts of employment with the company C.N.S. Ltd. concerning the same post. The contracts were for a continuous period which in total amounted to over seven years and seven months. 6.  On 5 June 2009 the applicant's employer returned the applicant's employment registration book to him, without any written or oral notification, showing that his employment had been terminated. 7.  On 20 July 2009 the applicant brought a civil action before the Ivanić Grad Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Ivanić Gradu). He asked it to recognise that he had concluded an open-ended contract of employment, given that he had been in continuous employment with his employer for over three years, which was the time-limit for fixed-term employment contracts under the Labour Act. He also asked the Municipal Court to establish that his employment had not been terminated and to order his reinstatement. 8.  On 22 January 2010 the Ivanić Grad Municipal Court dismissed the applicant's claim as time-barred. 9.  Upon an appeal by the applicant, on 16 February 2011 the Velika Gorica County Court (Županijski sud u Velikoj Gorici) quashed the first‑instance decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration. It held that the first-instance court should have declared the applicant's claims inadmissible as time-barred, without examining it on the merits. 10.  In the fresh proceedings, the Ivanić Grad Municipal Court on 6 May 2011 declared the applicant's action inadmissible as having been lodged outside the prescribed time-limit. The first-instance court, relying on section 133 of the Labour Act, held that the applicant and his employer had concluded a fixed-term contract lasting until 31 May 2009 and that the applicant must have known that his contract would end on that day. He had not concluded a new contract of employment with his employer and he had therefore been obliged to lodge an application for the protection of his rights with his employer within the fifteen-day time-limit, starting from 1 June 2009. However, he had failed to do so and consequently his claim had been lodged out of time. Rejecting the applicant's argument, the first‑instance court also held that the defendant company had not been obliged to adopt a formal decision on terminating his employment or to send him any other kind of notification, given that he must have known that his contract would come to an end on 31 May 2009. 11.  On 12 May 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Velika Gorica County Court. 12.  On 26 July 2011 the Velika Gorica County Court upheld the first‑instance decision. 13.  On 14 November 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (revizija) with the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske), which was dismissed as ill-founded on 25 September 2012. The Supreme Court also held that the applicant had failed to seek the protection of his rights in respect of his employer within the deadlines prescribed by section 133 of the Labour Act. Accordingly, his claim had been lodged out of time. 14.  On 14 March 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske). He complained that the courts had wrongly declared his claim inadmissible because it had been of a declaratory nature and as such had not been subject to deadlines. He relied on a decision by the Velika Gorica County Court of 16 January 2013 in the case of a colleague of his, who for the same reasons as the applicant had also sought to have the court recognise that he had concluded an open-ended contract of employment. In that decision the Velika Gorica County Court, in accordance with instructions given in the Supreme Court's decision no. Revr-1697/11 of 6 June 2012, had dismissed the defendant's (the employer's) objection that the claim was time-barred. Namely, the Supreme Court had held that the claim had been of a declaratory nature and as such was not subject to deadlines. 15.  On 6 May 2013 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant's constitutional complaint as manifestly ill-founded.

Explanation: There's no ambiguity regarding the applicant's right to a fair trial in this particular fact pattern. The premise revolves around a civil dispute over employment terms rather than the criminal proceedings outlined in Article 6. The applicant's primary legal challenge concerns the interpretation and application of the Labour Act, specifically whether his multiple fixed-term contracts constituted continuous employment, thus entitling him to an open-ended contract. Despite various appeals, the courts consistently ruled against the applicant based on procedural grounds, arguing his claim was time-barred. This situation doesn't directly involve the procedural rights under a criminal charge as outlined in Article 6, such as the right to legal assistance, to examine witnesses, or the presumption of innocence. Therefore, the facts do not suggest ambiguity in applying the right to a fair trial principles from Article 6 to this civil dispute about employment contracts.",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,1,"While it depends on the definition of ""reasonable time,"" it appears, with the multiple closings and reopenings, that the applicant did not receive a hearing within a reasonable time, as it took more than a year.",FALSE,N/A,overlook,FALSE

On 30 September 2007 a reading out of a press statement and a march were held in Diyarbakır in order to protest about the conditions of detention and alleged poisoning of Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party), an illegal armed organisation. The protesters gathered in front of the building of the Diyarbakır branch of the Democratic Society Party (Demokratik Toplum Partisi) (DTP) where a press statement was read out. They then marched. The applicant, as a member of the DTP, participated in the gathering and the ensuing march. According to a police report dated 9 October 2007, the applicant was seen while carrying a banner which read ""İnsanlık zehirleniyor"" (""The humanity is being poisoned"") and applauding together with other demonstrators in the police video footage. 7.  On 9 October 2007 the applicant was taken into police custody. On the same day she was detained on remand. 8.  On 17 October 2007 the Diyarbakır public prosecutor charged the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) on account of the content of the banner she had carried during the demonstration of 30 September 2007. 9.  On 4 December 2007 the applicant was released pending trial. 10.  On 18 March 2008 the Diyarbakır Assize Court convicted the applicant as charged. The court found it established, on the basis of an expert report on the police video footage, that the applicant had been together with other persons who had chanted the slogan ""Be Serok Jiyan Nabe"" (""There is no life without the leader"") and that she had carried a banner which read ""The humanity is being poisoned"". The applicant was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment. 11.  On 9 January 2012 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 18 March 2008. 12.  On an unspecified date the applicant started serving her prison sentence. On 17 July 2012, upon the applicant's request, the Diyarbakır Assize Court ordered her release from prison, in accordance with Law no. 6352 which had entered into force on 5 July 2012 and which had amended certain provisions of Law no. 3713.

Explanation: While some may argue the protesting rises to the level of threatening democratic interests through interfering with the reputation of others, the context of this being a protest and the applicant's membership with the protesting party makes it seem clear that this is the applicant's personal opinion.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Dubno. 6.  The applicant was the principal of a private school in the town of Dubno, in the Rivne Region. 7.  On 30 March 2000 criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant for failure to comply with a court decision ordering the reinstatement of a teacher at the private school. 8.  According to the applicant, at about 9.00 a.m. on 29 May 2000 officers from Dubno police broke down the front door of the applicant's house. Inside the house, an investigator from the Dubno inter-district prosecutor's office ordered the applicant to go to his office for questioning. When the applicant refused, the investigator asked the police officers to ensure her compulsory appearance for questioning. The police officers allegedly beat the applicant, twisted her arms behind her back and forced her out of the house barefoot. They placed her in a police car and took her to the office of the investigator. At about 1 p.m. on 29 May 2000 the applicant was released. 9.  On the next day, 30 May 2000, the applicant was examined by a doctor, who noted that there were injuries on her shoulders. 10.  On 9 April 2001 the Dubno inter-district prosecutor's office discontinued the investigation into the applicant's criminal case, having regard to the insignificance of her offence. 11.  On 2 August 2001 the Dubno Town Court quashed the decision of 9 April 2001 as unfounded and ordered that there be further investigation. 12.  On 14 August 2001 the investigation was completed and the case file was referred to the Dubno Town Court for trial. 13.  On 30 January 2004 and 13 March 2006 the Dubno Town Court issued judgments in the applicant's case, which were quashed as unfounded by the Rivne Regional Court of Appeal. 14.  On 30 January 2007 the Dubno Town Court convicted the applicant of failure to comply with a court decision, and decided that it was appropriate to punish her with a fine. However, ultimately it released the applicant from the punishment, as the statute of limitation had expired. 15.  On 17 April 2007 the Rivne Regional Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the judgment of 30 January 2007. 16.  On 13 November 2007 the Supreme Court refused to examine an appeal by the applicant on points of law, on the grounds that she had failed to comply with procedural rules when submitting it. 17.  On 2 June 2000 the applicant complained to the Rivne regional prosecutor's office regarding the events of 29 May 2000 (see paragraph 8 above). She was examined by a medical expert, who found that she had sustained five bruises to her shoulders and had injured her left shoulder ligaments. The expert stated that the injuries had been caused by blunt solid objects; they could have been sustained in the circumstances described by the applicant. 18.  On 30 June 2000 the Rivne regional prosecutor's office, having conducted a pre-investigation inquiry, refused to initiate criminal proceedings against the police officers because of the absence of the constituent elements of a criminal offence. 19.  On 20 March 2001, following a complaint by the applicant, the Prosecutor General's Office reversed the decision of 30 June 2000 as unsubstantiated, and ordered an additional inquiry. The applicant was not informed of the decision taken within the additional inquiry. In 2016 the Office of the Government Agent was informed that the file on those inquiries had been destroyed, along with other files relating to the same period, after the expiry of the statutory period for keeping such records. 20.  On 29 May 2003 the applicant lodged a civil claim with the Dubno Town Court, seeking damages for the violation of the inviolability of her home and her unlawful arrest and ill-treatment on 29 May 2000. 21.  On 9 July 2007 the Dubno Town Court found that on 29 May 2000 the applicant had been ill-treated and unlawfully taken from her home to the investigator's office. The court found that the authorities had acted unlawfully and that they had violated her right to the inviolability of her home, right to liberty and right to respect for human dignity. The court awarded the applicant 500 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH – approximately 73 euros (EUR) at the relevant time) in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. 22.  On 26 May 2008 the Lviv Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of 9 July 2007. 23.  The applicant appealed on points of law, contesting the amount of the award. 24.  On 8 May 2009 the Higher Administrative Court found that the appeal had not been prepared in a proper way. That court set a time-limit within which the applicant could rectify shortcomings in her appeal on points of law. 25.  On 13 July 2009 the Higher Administrative Court returned the applicant's appeal without examining it on the merits, after finding that she had failed to comply with the procedural requirements for submitting appeals.

Explanation: The fact pattern describes a situation where the applicant alleges to have been subjected to physical force that resulted in injuries, as evidenced by medical examination. The use of such force by police officers during her compulsory appearance for questioning and the subsequent physical injuries could potentially qualify as ""inhuman or degrading treatment"" under the Prohibition of Torture statute. However, the initiation and discontinuation of investigations, along with the judiciary's response to the applicant's claims of ill-treatment, introduce ambiguity regarding the satisfactory classification and redress of her treatment under this statute.

Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; 
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Naberezhnyye Chelny. 5.  The applicant was a police officer. On 1 November 2004 he was arrested on suspicion of having extracted a bribe. 6.  On 10 November 2005 the Supreme Court of the Tatarstan Republic convicted the applicant and sentenced him to imprisonment. He stayed under the obligation not to leave his place of residence in Naberezhnyye Chelny until the conviction became final. He could leave his place of residence only upon the summons from the investigator or the court. 7.  Several parties to the criminal proceedings, including the applicant, appealed against the conviction. The case was forwarded to the Russian Supreme Court in Moscow, 1,000 km away from Naberezhnyye Chelny. The applicant never received any summons to the appeal hearing due to the Supreme Court's mistake in the postal code. Neither did he receive copies of the statements of appeal filed by the prosecutor, by the co-accused, G., and the latter's lawyer. 8.  On 28 February 2006 the conviction was upheld by the Russian Supreme Court. The prosecutor and G.'s lawyer attended the appeal hearing. Neither the applicant nor his lawyer was present. 9.  In 2011 the applicant lodged a compensation claim for non-pecuniary damages caused by poor conditions of detention. In the text of his claim the applicant explicitly asked the court to consider the claim in his absence. On 14 April 2011 the Bugulminskiy Town Court of the Tatarstan Republic dismissed his claim. The applicant received the notification of the time and date of the hearing after the hearing had actually taken place. 10.  The first-instance judgment was upheld on 4 July 2011 by the Supreme Court of the Tatarstan Republic. The applicant had been notified of that hearing on 29 June 2011.

Explanation: The given fact pattern raises potential concerns regarding the right to liberty and security as outlined in Article 5, particularly in relation to the length of detention without a trial and the procedural handling of the applicant's detention and requests for release. Specifically, the prolonged periods of detention and the decisions made without oral hearings could be seen as contravening the stipulations that everyone arrested or detained shall be brought promptly before a judge (paragraph 3) and is entitled to have the lawfulness of his detention decided speedily by a court (paragraph 4). Given that the applicant's detention continued for over two years with multiple hearings and extensions without conclusive evidence leading to a trial, there is ambiguity regarding whether this situation fully respects the right to liberty and security as per the standards set in Article 5.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1,"While it depends on the definition of ""speedy,"" it appears that the lawfulness of the applicant's detention was not decided speedily, as it took more than 3 months.",FALSE,correct,N/A,TRUE

Protection of property 

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. 

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Moscow. 6.  On 29 December 2007 N., the owner of two rooms in flat 10 located at 3‑3, ulitsa Anny Severyanovoy, Moscow, signed a deed of gift in respect of the rooms for Ya. The Moscow City Department of the Federal Registration Service (the ""Registration Service"") registered the deed and Ya.'s title to the rooms. 7.  On an unspecified date the investigative committee opened criminal investigation into M.'s actions who was suspected of having tricked N. into signing the deed of gift for Ya.'s benefit. 8.  On 2 June 2008 Ya. sold the rooms to the applicant. According to the sale contract, the applicant paid 300,000 Russian roubles (RUB) for the rooms. 9.  On 11 July 2008 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court of Moscow issued a seizure order in respect of the rooms within the framework of the criminal investigation on the charges of fraud against M. 10.  On 16 July 2008 the Registration Service registered the sale agreement between Ya. and the applicant and the applicant's title to the rooms. 11.  On 28 September 2009 the District Court found M. guilty of multiple offences, including a fraud in respect of the room later purchased by the applicant, and sentenced him to fourteen years' imprisonment. The Court established that M. had tricked N. into signing the deed of gift in respect of the two rooms whilst M. had actually sold the rooms to Ya. 12.  On 16 March 2010 N. died. 13.  On 7 February 2014 the Department of Housing of the City of Moscow (the ""Housing Department"") brought a civil action seeking restitution of the title to the two rooms to the City of Moscow and the applicant's eviction. 14.  On 29 December 2014 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow granted the Housing Department's claims. The court found the deed of gift null and void. It further established that N., the lawful owner of the rooms, had died intestate and without heirs. Accordingly the rooms should be considered a bona vacantia and should be transferred to the City of Moscow, even though the applicant had bought the rooms in good faith. The court transferred the title to the rooms to the City of Moscow and ordered the applicant's eviction. 15.  On 18 June 2015 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 29 December 2014 on appeal. 16.  On 26 October 2015 the City Court refused to grant the applicant leave to a cassation appeal against the judgments of 29 December 2014 and 18 June 2015. 17.  On 9 March 2015 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation issued a similar decision. 18.  The parties did not provide any information as regards the enforcement of the judgments in the City's favour.

1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. 

2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant, who was born in 1948, lives in Corjova, a village under the formal control of Moldovan authorities, but where agents of the self‑proclaimed ""Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic"" (""MRT"", see Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, § 90, ECHR 2004‑VII for further details) frequently intervened during the events in question, notably by blocking the participation of the local population in elections held in Moldova. 6.  On 3 June 2007 local elections were to be held in Moldova, including in Corjova. The applicant, who is an ambulance driver, submitted his candidature for the position of Mayor of Corjova. 7.  On 1 June 2007, at 11 p.m., the applicant's ambulance was stopped by the ""MRT"" road militia and his documents (Moldovan national identity card and driving licence) were taken away from him without any explanation. 8.  On 2 June 2007 the applicant went to the ""MRT"" militia station located in Dubăsari and asked for the return of his documents. He was then arrested and placed in a detention cell. A few hours later a person came to his cell and, without presenting himself, asked him about his work and his electoral propaganda. The applicant later found out that the visitor had been a judge and that, following that discussion in the cell, the judge adopted a decision, finding him guilty of the administrative offence of unlawful electoral propaganda and sentencing him to 15 days' administrative detention. 9.  The applicant submits that he was not allowed to contact his relatives or to find a lawyer, and was not issued with a copy of the court's decision, which prevented any possibility of lodging an effective appeal against the decision of 2 June 2007. 10.  During his detention the applicant was placed in a cell which, according to him was damp and cold. Food was given once a day. When the applicant's relatives, alerted by his absence, contacted the local authorities in order to find out about his fate, they were informed of the applicant's detention. However, their requests to transmit food to him were allegedly rejected. 11.  On 17 June 2007 the applicant was released from detention and he was issued with a copy of the decision of 2 June 2007. The time-limit for lodging an appeal had already expired by that time. Upon release, he was allegedly coughing and was diagnosed with chronic acute bronchitis. He also claims that his eyesight worsened considerably. 12.  In the meantime, on 6 June 2007, the applicant complained to the Moldovan prosecutor's office of his unlawful detention. Based on this complaint, a criminal investigation was initiated on 12 June 2007, the applicant and witnesses were subsequently heard. Three high-ranking ""MRT"" officers were charged and were declared wanted persons. However, on 4 August 2010 the investigation was suspended due to the fact that the three accused were hiding from it in the ""MRT"".

Explanation: The situation involves an ambiguity regarding the application of Article 10, Freedom of expression, in the context of the intervention by the ""MRT"" which contradicts the protocol of free speech and electoral participation. This ambiguity arises from the balance between the right to freedom of expression, including the right to participate in local elections, and actions taken by what appears to be a de facto authority that restricts this right under the guise of maintaining public order through the detention of the applicant and the accusation of unlawful electoral propaganda. The right to freedom of expression is meant to be upheld regardless of interference by public authorities, yet the fact pattern demonstrates that the applicant's rights were infringed upon under circumstances that were not clearly justified or lawful, particularly considering the lack of access to appeal. This scenario presents an unclear application and limitation of the freedom of expression as prescribed by the statute due to extra-legal actions taken by a non-recognized authority.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,The MRT has clearly acted against the interests of a democratic society in blocking election participation and infringing on the rights of the applicant.,FALSE,N/A,unusual def,FALSE

Right to life 

1. Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law. 

2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary: 
(a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence; 
(b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicants were born in 1939 and 1944 respectively and live in Dumbrăvița, Timiș County. 5.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, refer to the same context and domestic criminal proceedings as those described in Association ""21 December 1989"" and Others v. Romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 May 2011) and Şandru and Others v. Romania (no. 22465/03, §§ 7-47, 8 December 2009). 6.  Between 17 and 28 December 1989 many people, including the applicants' son, participated in anti-communism demonstrations in Timișoara, Bucharest and other cities in Romania. 7.  The applicants' son was killed by gunfire on 23 December 1989 in Timișoara. 8.  In 1990 the military prosecutor's office opened several investigations into the December 1989 armed crackdown on the anti-communism demonstrations. A main criminal investigation concerning the use of violence against civilians in Bucharest and other cities, which was found excessive, was also registered with the highest prosecutor's office – the military prosecutors section − under no. 97/P/1990 (current number 11/P/2014). 9.  In cases concerning the events in Timișoara, a separate investigation was carried out under file no. 11/P/1996, culminating in the referral to court and subsequent conviction of senior military officers by a decision of the High Court of Cassation and Justice of 3 April 2007, which became final on 15 October 2008. As is apparent from the documents submitted by the parties, the death of the applicants' son did not form part of this investigation, but in the court proceedings the first applicant nonetheless lodged a civil claim regarding his son's death during the December 1989 events. The court dismissed it on the grounds that he had failed to submit documents substantiating this claim. 10.  As acknowledged by the Government, both applicants are parties in the main criminal investigation file. On 26 June 2013 they brought civil claims before the prosecutor requesting the right to participate, being civil parties in this file. The applicants had first made statements and raised civil claims in criminal investigation files other than file no. 97/P/1990 (current number 11/P/2014) on 11 January 1990 and 1 March 2000. The parties did not inform the Court whether these files had been joined to the main criminal investigation (see paragraph 8 above). 11.  The most important steps taken by the prosecutors in the main criminal investigation are summarised in Association ""21 December 1989"" and Others (cited above, §§ 12-41) and Anamaria‑Loredana Orășanu and Others v. Romania ([Committee] nos. 43629/13 and 74 others, §§ 10‑11, 7 November 2017). Further developments are as follows. 12.  On 14 October 2015 the prosecutor's office closed the main investigation, finding that the offences of homicide and instigation to homicide of which the applicants' son had been a victim had become statute‑barred. 13.  Although the parties have not communicated any information regarding the lodging of an appeal against this decision, it is apparent from the prosecutor's office website that it was subsequently quashed and to date the main criminal investigation is still ongoing (see Anamaria‑Loredana Orășanu and Others, cited above, § 11).

Right to education 

No person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1981 and lives in Milcovățu. In 2008 he was convicted of burglary and served a sentence of imprisonment until 30 August 2011, when he was conditionally released. 6.  Between 2007 and 2009 the applicant completed the last two years of his primary education (grades III and IV) in Rahova Prison, within the framework of the ""Second Chance"" educational programme for prisoners. 7.  Following a transfer to Jilava Prison, between May and August 2010 the applicant lodged three requests with the prison administration, asking to be enrolled in secondary education (the educational stage corresponding to grades V-VIII) as a fifth grade student. 8.  On 29 July 2010 the Jilava prison governor wrote to the Ilfov County Schools Inspectorate (""the schools inspectorate"") pointing out that, under legislation enacted earlier that year (see paragraph 16 below), prisoners were required to receive compulsory education. He included information on the number and educational levels of the prisoners concerned and asked the schools inspectorate to consider the possibilities available to them to complete their compulsory education. In a reply of 24 August 2010 the schools inspectorate notified the prison governor that a class had been set up at School No. 1 in Jilava (""the school"") for primary education and that, as regards secondary education, it was necessary to submit, to the same school, the documents necessary for the prisoners' enrolment, as required by ministerial Order no. 4370/2000 on part-time secondary education (see paragraph 18 below). 9.  In the meantime, the prison administration informed the applicant that his request to be enrolled had been considered and that he was required to provide his academic record from his previous school. On 2 September 2010 the applicant gave his written consent for the prison administration to request his academic record. 10.  On 21 September 2010 Jilava Prison and the school signed a collaboration protocol concerning the education of prisoners at primary and secondary level in the academic year 2010/2011. Following this, on 28 October 2010 the prison governor wrote to the school asking to be informed of the starting date of the secondary education courses. The letter also stated that the schools inspectorate had given its approval for the courses to be organised on the prison premises, that the conditions for organising them had been met, and that additional documents concerning the prisoners' previous education were to be sent to the school once they became available. 11.  On the same day the applicant lodged a complaint with the judge delegated to supervise the observance of prisoners' rights (""the post‑sentencing judge""), alleging that the prison administration had violated his right to education. At a hearing of 29 October 2010 he stated that the prison administration had approved his request to be allowed to study, but had informed him that no teacher wished to teach in the prison. 12.  While the proceedings before the post-sentencing judge were ongoing, in a letter of 4 November 2010 the school informed the prison administration that the prisoners' enrolment applications did not contain the necessary documents, as required by ministerial Order no. 4370/2000 (see paragraph 18 below). The letter also pointed out, without reference to any individual situation, that academic records had been submitted in respect of only five of the sixteen prisoners who had requested to be enrolled. It then listed the number of prisoners who could potentially be enrolled in grades VI to VIII and concluded that it was not possible to arrange for teachers to teach each subject to a class containing only one student, as was the case in respect of grade VII. The letter also stated that the schools inspectorate had been notified accordingly. 13.  In a decision of 16 November 2010 the post-sentencing judge dismissed the applicant's complaint as ill-founded. The decision stated that the Education Act and the Execution of Sentences Act (see paragraphs 15‑16 below) imposed a positive obligation on prison administrations, together with the educational authorities, to ensure prisoners' access to compulsory education. The prison administration had taken all the necessary steps to ensure that the applicant and other prisoners had access to secondary education in prison, in accordance with the law. In particular, it had duly approached the competent institutions, and on 29 October 2010 it had sent the school the applicant's and other prisoners' study documents and academic records. Therefore, the applicant's inability to pursue his studies was not imputable to the prison administration, but to the insufficient number of students, which constituted an impediment to the establishment of a class for secondary education. 14.  The applicant appealed against that decision. He argued that prison administrations were under a clear legal obligation to ensure prisoners' access to secondary education, irrespective of their number. On 12 January 2011 the Bucharest County Court gave a final judgment which upheld the ruling made by the post-sentencing judge. It concluded that the applicant's inability to continue his studies had been due to a situation outside of everyone's control, namely an insufficient number of students to set up a class in accordance with the law.

The letter also pointed out, without reference to any individual situation, that academic records had been submitted in respect of only five of the sixteen prisoners who had requested to be enrolled. It then listed the number of prisoners who could potentially be enrolled in grades VI to VIII and concluded that it was not possible to arrange for teachers to teach each subject to a class containing only one student, as was the case in respect of grade VII. The letter also stated that the schools inspectorate had been notified accordingly. 13.  In a decision of 16 November 2010 the post-sentencing judge dismissed the applicant's complaint as ill-founded. The decision stated that the Education Act and the Execution of Sentences Act (see paragraphs 15‑16 below) imposed a positive obligation on prison administrations, together with the educational authorities, to ensure prisoners' access to compulsory education. The prison administration had taken all the necessary steps to ensure that the applicant and other prisoners had access to secondary education in prison, in accordance with the law. In particular, it had duly approached the competent institutions, and on 29 October 2010 it had sent the school the applicant's and other prisoners' study documents and academic records. Therefore, the applicant's inability to pursue his studies was not imputable to the prison administration, but to the insufficient number of students, which constituted an impediment to the establishment of a class for secondary education. 14.  The applicant appealed against that decision. He argued that prison administrations were under a clear legal obligation to ensure prisoners' access to secondary education, irrespective of their number. On 12 January 2011 the Bucharest County Court gave a final judgment which upheld the ruling made by the post-sentencing judge. It concluded that the applicant's inability to continue his studies had been due to a situation outside of everyone's control, namely an insufficient number of students to set up a class in accordance with the law.","True

Explanation: The fact pattern suggests ambiguity in how the right to education, as guaranteed by Protocol 1 Article 2, applies within the context of prison education. The protocol specifies that no person shall be denied the right to education, but the fact pattern reveals complexities related to implementing this right in a prison setting, highlighting difficulties such as enrolling prisoners in education programs due to logistical issues and finding educators willing to teach in such environments. Moreover, the decision regarding the applicant's right to education was influenced by the number of students available to form a class, which suggests ambiguity in the application of the right to education in scenarios where external factors, such as student numbers, impact the feasibility of providing education.

Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; 
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Bucharest. 5.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, refer to the same context and domestic criminal proceedings as those described in the case Association ""21 December 1989"" and Others v. Romania (nos. 33810/07 and 18817/08, §§ 12-41, 24 May 2011). 6.  During the events which led to the fall of the communist regime, on the night of 21/22 December 1989 the applicant's son was killed by gunfire in Bucharest. 7.  In 1990 the military prosecutor's office opened several investigations into the December 1989 armed crackdown on the anti-communism demonstrations. A main criminal investigation concerning the use of violence against civilians in Bucharest and other cities was registered with the highest prosecutor's office – the military prosecutors section − under no. 97/P/1990 (current number 11/P/2014). In the main criminal investigation the applicant raised civil claims and asked that the perpetrators of the offence of homicide committed against her son be identified and punished. 8.  At the same time, another investigation concerning the offences of complicity in seriously aggravated homicide and complicity in attempted seriously aggravated homicide, committed against a large number of persons, including the applicant's son, culminated in the committal for trial of public officials, members of the ruling political party, and their subsequent conviction by a final decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 20 April 1992. 9.   The relevant procedural steps taken in the main criminal investigation were described in the cases Association ""21 December 1989"" and Others (cited above, §§ 12-41) and Sidea and Others v. Romania ([Committee] no. 889/15, §§ 8-11, 5 June 2018). 10.  On 14 October 2015 the military prosecutor's office closed the main criminal investigation, finding that the applicant's complaint regarding the offence of homicide committed against her son was statute-barred and that a complaint concerning instigation of homicide was a matter of res judicata following the Supreme Court of Justice's decision of 20 April 1992 (see paragraph 8 above). 11.  The decision of 14 October 2015 was subsequently annulled by a Prosecutor General's decision of 5 April 2016, confirmed by the High Court of Cassation and Justice on 13 June 2016. On 1 November 2016 the military prosecutor ordered the opening of a criminal investigation in rem for the offence of crimes against humanity in respect of the same factual circumstances. 12.  According to the information submitted by the parties, the main criminal investigation is still ongoing (see Bănuțoiu and Ștefoglu v. Romania [Committee], nos. 64752/13 and 54607/14, § 12, 3 July 2018).

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was employed by HK Komgrap and Komgrap-Makiš doo, a company based in Belgrade (hereinafter ""the debtor""). At the relevant time, the company was predominantly socially-owned (see Stoković and Others v. Serbia, nos. 75879/14 and seq. §§ 10-14, 8 March 2016) 6.  Since the debtor had failed to fulfil its obligations towards its employees, the applicant brought a civil claim seeking payment of salary arrears and various social security contributions. 7.  On 23 June 2003 the Belgrade Second Municipal Court (Drugi opštinski sud u Beogradu) ordered the debtor to pay to the applicant certain sums in respect of salary arrears and the various social security contributions. This judgment became final and enforceable on 25 July 2005. 8.  On 26 September 2005 the applicant applied to the Belgrade Fourth Municipal Court (Četvrti opštinski sud u Beogradu) for enforcement of the judgment of 23 June 2003. 9.  On 18 January 2006 the said court ordered the enforcement of the judgment and awarded the applicant the costs incurred in the enforcement proceedings. 10.  On 27 October 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal, seeking redress for the non-enforcement of the judgment in question. 11.  On 27 November 2013 the Constitutional Court held that the applicant had suffered a breach of the ""right to a trial within a reasonable time"" with regard to the enforcement proceedings. The court ordered the acceleration of these proceedings and declared that the applicant was entitled to compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered in the amount of 800 euros (EUR) converted into the national currency at the rate applicable at the date of settlement. 12.  The Constitutional Court held that since the enforcement proceedings in question had not yet been completed, the constitutional appeals were premature in so far as they concerned the pecuniary damage, and dismissed the appeal in that regard.

Explanation: In the fact pattern, the applicant faced a significant delay in the enforcement of a final and enforceable judgment regarding salary arrears and social security contributions. This delay led to a breach of the ""right to a trial within a reasonable time,"" as recognized by the Constitutional Court. The statute under Article 6 emphasizes the right to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time, which is directly relevant to the applicant's situation. Furthermore, the ongoing delays and the need for constitutional court intervention to hasten enforcement proceedings suggest ambiguities in the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal enforcement mechanisms in ensuring a fair trial within a reasonable timeframe. Hence, there is ambiguity in how the statute's requirement for a trial (or proceeding, such as enforcement of judgment) within a reasonable time is applied or interpreted in the applicant's case, supporting the response of ""True.""",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1,"While it depends on the definition of ""reasonable time,"" it appears, according to the Constitutional Court, that the applicant did not receive a hearing within a reasonable time.",FALSE,correct,N/A,FALSE

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Weinheim. He is a campaigner against abortion and operates an anti-abortion website (babycaust.de). At the time of the proceedings outlined below, the website included, among other things, the following content. 6.  On the starting page a picture of graves was shown and the text underneath read ""then: Holocaust"". Upon clicking on the picture, the user was directed to a page titled: ""Abortion – the new Holocaust?"" on which the Holocaust was compared to abortions. On the left margin of the starting page, there were several links, of which one was called ""Life or death?"". Upon clicking on it, the user was directed to a page with the headline ""Prayer requests for Germany"". From that page, the reader was directed to a location-based alphabetical list mentioning the names and practice addresses of doctors who performed abortions in Germany, and to a request for prayers for those doctors.
At the very bottom of the same page, under the highlighted text ""German contemporary history in brief"", a sentence read:
""Perverted doctors murder unborn children at the request of the mothers"" (Pervertierte Ärzte ermorden im Auftrag der Mütter die ungeborenen Kinder)
On the same page, clicking on the button ""close page"" forwarded the user to a page where it was stated:
""Pray, if possible regularly, for the doctors ... who personally undertake the AGGRAVATED MURDER of abortion killing"" (Beten Sie – wenn möglich regelmäßig – für die Mediziner ..., welche den MORD der Abtreibungstötung selbst vornehmen ...) (Emphasis in original).
Somewhat farther down on the same page, it was stated that counselling centres that issued certifications:
""... are enabling and facilitating the unpunished aggravated murder of children in their mother's womb."" (... ermöglichen und begünstigen einen straffreien Kindermord im Mutterschoβ.) 7.  One of the doctors listed on the applicant's website, Dr Q., sought a civil injunction ordering the applicant to remove his name and address from the website. 8.  On 23 May 2006 the Mannheim Regional Court rejected Dr Q.'s application on the grounds that it was a fact that Dr Q. performed abortions and that the remainder of the website's content was covered by the applicant's freedom of expression. It observed, in particular, that the present case was not comparable to similar cases which had concerned an interference with personality rights by the distribution of personalised leaflets. The publishing of a doctor's name on a list of abortion performing doctors had no comparable ""pillory effect"". 9.  Subsequently Dr Q. appealed and – during the appeal proceedings –
modified his application, seeking a civil injunction ordering the applicant to desist from labelling abortions, such as those performed by Dr Q., ""aggravated murder"". 10.  On 28 February 2007 the Karlsruhe Court of Appeal granted the sought injunction. The court held that the applicant's website led it to be understood that abortions performed by Dr Q. constituted ""aggravated murder"". While the term ""aggravated murder"" did not have to be understood in a merely legal sense but could also be understood as a moral judgment, the overall presentation of the website at the very least did not exclude a reading that Dr Q. had perpetrated the criminal offence of aggravated murder. Even though the applicant had pointed out that abortions were exempt from punishment, he had not referred to section 218a of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 14 below), which exempted abortions as performed by Dr Q., from criminal liability. In addition, the applicant had emphasised the term ""aggravated murder"" in the relevant parts of the website and had compared abortions with the Holocaust. In sum, the statements of the website could be understood as a personalised accusation against Dr Q. of perpetrating aggravated murder. 11.  On 29 May 2007 the Federal Court of Justice refused a request by the applicant for legal aid on the grounds that the applicant's intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success. 12.  On 2 July 2009 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit a complaint by the applicant for adjudication for being inadmissible, without providing reasons (no. 1 BvR 1663/07).

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant, who was born in 1948, lives in Corjova, a village under the formal control of Moldovan authorities, but where agents of the self‑proclaimed ""Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic"" (""MRT"", see Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia [GC], no. 48787/99, § 90, ECHR 2004‑VII for further details) frequently intervened during the events in question, notably by blocking the participation of the local population in elections held in Moldova. 6.  On 3 June 2007 local elections were to be held in Moldova, including in Corjova. The applicant, who is an ambulance driver, submitted his candidature for the position of Mayor of Corjova. 7.  On 1 June 2007, at 11 p.m., the applicant's ambulance was stopped by the ""MRT"" road militia and his documents (Moldovan national identity card and driving licence) were taken away from him without any explanation. 8.  On 2 June 2007 the applicant went to the ""MRT"" militia station located in Dubăsari and asked for the return of his documents. He was then arrested and placed in a detention cell. A few hours later a person came to his cell and, without presenting himself, asked him about his work and his electoral propaganda. The applicant later found out that the visitor had been a judge and that, following that discussion in the cell, the judge adopted a decision, finding him guilty of the administrative offence of unlawful electoral propaganda and sentencing him to 15 days' administrative detention. 9.  The applicant submits that he was not allowed to contact his relatives or to find a lawyer, and was not issued with a copy of the court's decision, which prevented any possibility of lodging an effective appeal against the decision of 2 June 2007. 10.  During his detention the applicant was placed in a cell which, according to him was damp and cold. Food was given once a day. When the applicant's relatives, alerted by his absence, contacted the local authorities in order to find out about his fate, they were informed of the applicant's detention. However, their requests to transmit food to him were allegedly rejected. 11.  On 17 June 2007 the applicant was released from detention and he was issued with a copy of the decision of 2 June 2007. The time-limit for lodging an appeal had already expired by that time. Upon release, he was allegedly coughing and was diagnosed with chronic acute bronchitis. He also claims that his eyesight worsened considerably. 12.  In the meantime, on 6 June 2007, the applicant complained to the Moldovan prosecutor's office of his unlawful detention. Based on this complaint, a criminal investigation was initiated on 12 June 2007, the applicant and witnesses were subsequently heard. Three high-ranking ""MRT"" officers were charged and were declared wanted persons.

Explanation: The application of Article 10 (Freedom of expression) to the fact pattern demonstrates ambiguity regarding the balance between the exercise of freedom of expression and the restrictions imposed for the reasons outlined in the statute (e.g., public safety, the protection of the rights of others). The applicant was arrested and detained, ostensibly for ""unlawful electoral propaganda,"" which directly intersects with the concept of freedom of expression. The conditions under which the applicant's rights were restricted, including the procedural fairness of his detention and the lack of opportunity to appeal, raise questions about whether the restrictions on his freedom of expression (and his subsequent arrest and detention related to those expressions) were ""prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society"" for any of the purposes stated in the statute.

This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. 

2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Bern, Switzerland. At the time of the events giving rise to the present application, he was the editor‑in-chief of Ülkede Özgür Gündem, a daily newspaper published in Turkey. 6.  On 6 July 2004 an article written by Mr B.G. entitled ""Analysing the Kurdish dynamic correctly"" was published in Ülkede Özgür Gündem. In his article, Mr B.G. stated his views on the role of Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK (an illegal armed organisation), a number of organisations associated with the PKK in regional and international politics and political developments in Turkey. Next to the article a photograph of Abdullah Öcalan shaking hands with a group of armed men was published. 7.  On 8 July 2004 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul Assize Court filed a bill of indictment, charging the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of the KONGRA-GEL[1] under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) on account of the article published on 6 July 2004. In the indictment, the public prosecutor quoted the following passage from the article:
""... Abdullah Öcalan, who has contributed to the essential dynamic of the Kurdish movement and the HPG[2], the PJA[3] and the KONGRA-GEL, organisations which have acted as military, political and ideological leaders and which have represented his leadership,... [must be well understood]"".
The public prosecutor stated that a photograph of Abdullah Öcalan in which he was standing in a rural area holding a weapon had been published in the newspaper, next to the article. The public prosecutor considered as a result that the applicant had disseminated propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation inciting others to violence or other methods of terrorism. Subsequently, criminal proceedings were launched against the applicant before the Istanbul Assize Court. 8.  During the proceedings the applicant maintained that the article in question had been a news article and had not contained propaganda inciting to violence. 9.  On 24 May 2005 the Istanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant of disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK/KONGRA-GEL under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 and sentenced him to six months' imprisonment and a fine. In its judgment, the Istanbul Assize Court held that the content of the article and the publication of Abdullah Öcalan's photograph amounted to dissemination of propaganda in favour of the PKK/KONGRA-GEL. 10.  The applicant appealed. In his appeal petition, referring to a number of the Court's judgments, the applicant claimed that he had not had the intention of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation and that his criminal conviction had been in breach of Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention as he had been exercising his right to impart information. He also noted that the first-instance court had failed to examine the article in its entirety. 11.  On 16 May 2006 the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation returned the case file to the first-instance court and requested that the latter revise its judgment in the light of the recent legislative amendments. 12.  On 28 September 2006 the Istanbul Assize Court once again convicted the applicant under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713, with the same reasoning that it had adopted on 24 May 2005. The court sentenced the applicant to a fine of 1,802 Turkish liras (TRY). 13.  The applicant appealed. 14.  On 18 November 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 28 September 2006. 15.  According to a document dated 15 January 2010, signed by the President of the Istanbul Assize Court and the Istanbul public prosecutor, the applicant was required to pay the fine of TRY 1,802.

Explanation: The ambiguity in this case revolves around the balance between freedom of expression and the limitations imposed for reasons such as national security or the prevention of disorder. The statute protects the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to hold opinions and impart information without interference by public authority. However, it also allows for restrictions on this freedom under specific circumstances deemed necessary in a democratic society, such as for the prevention of disorder or crime, national security, or maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

In the fact pattern, the prosecution of the applicant for publishing an article and a photograph perceived as propaganda in favor of a terrorist organization raises questions about where the boundary lies between the exercise of freedom of expression and the propagation of views that could incite violence or terrorism. The applicant's claim that the article was a news piece and not propaganda, and his conviction despite this claim, highlight the ambiguity in determining what constitutes incitement to violence or terrorism and when it is necessary to restrict freedom of expression to protect national security or prevent disorder.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1,"There is a view, as the public prosecutor argued, that this article threatens the interests of democratic society by inciting violence.

Prohibition of discrimination 

The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Ostia Lido. 6.  At birth, the applicant was entered in the civil-status registers as male and was given the forename L. However, the applicant stated that she had always identified as female and lived in society as a woman under the forename S. For instance, her work colleagues (the applicant has worked as a civil servant since 1999) had always called her S., and in the photograph on her identity card issued in August 2000 her appearance was that of a woman. 7.  In 1999 S.V. began treatment with feminising hormones as part of the gender transition process. 8.  On 9 November 2000 she applied to the Rome District Court on the basis of section 3 of Law no. 164 of 1982, stating that she wished to complete the transition process by permanently changing her primary sexual characteristics, and sought authorisation to undergo gender reassignment surgery. 9.  In a judgment of 10 May 2001 the District Court found that the applicant had embarked on the gender transition process after careful consideration. Having taken note of her determination the court authorised her to undergo surgery in order to adapt her primary sexual characteristics to match her female gender identity. 10.  On 30 May 2001 the applicant, while awaiting the surgery authorised by the District Court, applied to the prefect of Rome for a change of forename under Article 89 of Presidential Decree no. 396 of 2000. She argued that, given that she had been undergoing a gender transition process for several years, and in view of her physical appearance, the fact that her identity papers indicated a male forename was a constant source of humiliation and embarrassment. She also asserted that the waiting period for surgery was approximately four years. 11.  In a decision of 4 July 2001 the prefect refused the applicant's request on the grounds that, under Presidential Decree no. 396 of 2000, a person's forename had to correspond to his or her gender. In the prefect's view, in the absence of a final court ruling ordering the change to her legal gender status for the purposes of Law no. 164 of 1982, the applicant's forename could not be changed. 12.  The applicant appealed against that decision to the Lazio Regional Administrative Court and also requested a stay of execution of the prefect's decision. 13.  On 23 July 2001 the applicant underwent mammoplasty. On 6 September 2001 she was placed on a waiting list at Trieste University Hospital for surgery to alter her primary sexual characteristics. 14.  On 21 February 2002 the Regional Administrative Court refused to grant a stay of execution of the prefect's decision. 15.  On 3 February 2003, while the proceedings before the Regional Administrative Court were still pending on the merits, the applicant underwent an operation to change her sexual characteristics from male to female. She subsequently applied to the Rome District Court, on an unspecified date, for legal recognition of her gender reassignment under section 3 of Law no. 164 of 1982. 16.  In a judgment of 10 October 2003 the Rome District Court granted the applicant's request and ordered the Savona municipal authorities to alter the indication of the applicant's gender from male to female and to change the forename L. to S. 17.  By a judgment of 6 March 2008, deposited with the registry on 17 May 2008, the Regional Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the prefect's decision of 4 July 2001. The court held that Article 89 of Presidential Decree no. 396 of 2000 concerning changes of forename was not applicable in the present case, which actually came within the scope of Law no. 164 of 1982 concerning changes to legal gender status. The court stressed in that regard that, under the terms of the latter, the amendment of the civil-status records of a transgender person had to be ordered by the court ruling on his or her gender reassignment. It therefore considered that the prefect had correctly refused the applicant's request.
The applicant did not appeal against that judgment.

Explanation: The applicant was discriminated on by basis of gender, but arguably not the by-birth gender. It depends on the interpretation of the grounds listed in the statute.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Warsaw. 5.  On 29 November 2012 the Warsaw-Wola District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered the applicant's detention on remand on suspicion of drug dealing, as well as facilitating and benefiting from prostitution, committed in an organised criminal group. The domestic court relied on a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question, on the fact that he faced a severe penalty and that he was suspected of acting with accomplices. The likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences in question was established, in particular, on the basis of the testimony of a key prosecution witness (the so-called ""crown witness""). 6.  On 8 January 2013 the Warsaw Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed the applicant's appeal against this decision. It stressed that the sole fact that the applicant faced a severe penalty and had been suspected of committing offences in an organised criminal group justified a suspicion that, if released, the applicant would try to obstruct the proceedings by influencing witnesses or his accomplices. 7.  The applicant's detention on remand was extended by the Warsaw Regional Court on 21 February, 27 May and 8 August 2013. In these decisions, the court repeated the reasons originally relied on. In its decision of 21 February 2013, the Warsaw Regional Court further noted that the case against the applicant was complex, and indicated a number of steps that still had to be taken in order to terminate the investigation. The court noted that not all of those steps required the applicant's detention and urged the prosecutor to accelerate the proceedings. 8.  The applicant appealed against all these decisions, without success. 9.  On 21 November 2013 the Warsaw Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) ordered a further extension of the applicant's detention on remand. It relied on the same grounds as previously given for his detention. The applicant appealed. The decision was upheld on appeal on 12 December 2013. 10.  The bill of indictment against the applicant was lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court on 30 December 2013. The applicant was charged with ten offences committed in an organised criminal group and – in the case of some of the offences – as a re-offender. The charges included facilitating prostitution by renting an apartment to prostitutes and collecting money from them, and a number of counts of drug possession and distribution. The bill of indictment concerned altogether seventeen accused, charged with 150 offences. Later, the number of accused in the proceedings dropped to fourteen. The prosecutor requested that the court hear over 90 witnesses, including five ""crown witnesses"". 11.  Subsequently, the applicant's detention pending trial was extended by the Warsaw Regional Court's decisions of 10 January and 7 May 2014 and by the Warsaw Court of Appeal's decisions of 30 December 2014, 28 April, 27 August and 26 November 2015, and of 25 February and 25 May 2016. The domestic courts continued to rely on the same grounds for detention as in their previous decisions. They also stressed the complexity of the case and the links between the co-accused within an organised criminal group which, according to the domestic courts, justified a suspicion that, if released, they would attempt to obstruct the proper course of the proceedings. 12.  The appeals by the applicant against decisions extending his detention and all his applications for release were unsuccessful. 13.  On 9 May 2016 the trial court ordered the applicant's release on bail for 80,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approximately 20,000 euros (EUR)). The applicant appealed against this decision, contesting the amount of bail as excessive. On 25 May 2016 the Warsaw Court of Appeal upheld the decision. It underlined that the amount of bail had to take into consideration not only the financial situation of the applicant, but also the gravity of the charges against him. The court also stated that it had taken into consideration the fact that the applicant had abused his procedural rights in order to obstruct and delay the proceedings. It indicated that the amount in question had to be such that the prospect of its loss would constitute a genuine deterrent against any illegal activities which, until that moment, had been prevented by the applicant's detention. 14.  On 30 May 2016 the Warsaw Regional Court again ordered the applicant's release on bail of PLN 80,000. It also imposed a prohibition on leaving the country. The applicant paid the security required by the court and was released on 31 May 2016. 15.  The case against the applicant and his co-accused appears to be pending before the Warsaw Regional Court (no. XII K 1/14). The material includes 188 volumes.

Explanation: The fact pattern provided demonstrates a detailed process through which the applicant's detention was regularly reviewed by various courts which consistently found grounds for the detention related to the complexity of the case, the severity of the charges, and the risk of the applicant influencing witnesses or accomplices if released. Each extension of the detention on remand was based on these considerations, and the courts also considered the applicant's procedural rights by allowing appeals against decisions extending detention and setting bail as a condition for release. The repeated court decisions emphasizing the same grounds for detention indicate that the detention was in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law for the purposes outlined in Article 5, specifically under points (a) and (c), regarding lawful detention after conviction or suspicion of having committed an offence. Furthermore, the decision to release the applicant on bail, which was contested and subsequently upheld, shows an adherence to legal procedures and consideration for the balance between the applicant's liberty and the requirements of the legal process.

Prohibition of torture 

No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1963. 6.  From 22 July 2016 the applicant was held in the Chernigiv pre-trial detention centre (""the SIZO"") as a suspect in respect of a crime. 7.  On 8 September 2016, while being held at the SIZO, the applicant suffered acute myocardial infarction. He was treated at Kozeletsk Town Hospital from 8 until 19 September 2016. 8.  On 27 September and 6 October 2016 the applicant underwent examinations at the Chernigiv Regional Cardiological Centre. He was diagnosed with ischemic heart disease; acute myocardial infarction; third‑stage hypertonic disease; a hypertensive heart; and second-degree heart failure. The applicant was prescribed outpatient medical treatment and a further heart examination. On the last mentioned date he was recommended to undergo a cardiac ventriculography test. 9.  On 7 February 2017, in response to a request for information lodged by the Chernigiv regional prosecutor's office, Chernihiv City Hospital (""the Hospital"") noted that the applicant's state of health posed a high risk to his life. 10.  On 15 March 2017, the Hospital informed the SIZO authorities that the cost of a cardiac ventriculography test was 4,000 hryvnias (UAH – approximately 140 euros (EUR)). There is no information regarding whether that test was undertaken. 11.  Following a deterioration in the applicant's health, on 23 May 2017 the Court indicated to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that they should immediately ensure that the recommended treatment was available and provided to the applicant and that the applicant was placed in a specialised medical institution for medical treatment – including surgery, if appropriate. 12.  On 23 May 2017 the applicant was transported to the Hospital, where the previous diagnosis was confirmed (see paragraph 8 above). On the same day he was returned to the SIZO and provided with outpatient treatment. 13.  On 25 May 2017 the Hospital informed the SIZO that in order for the applicant to be provided with qualified medical advice, he needed a cardiac ventriculography test. In view of the complexity of the applicant's state of health, before the cardiac ventriculography test the Hospital requested that the applicant have an additional consultation at the Amosov Cardiology Institute. 14.  According to the Government, the SIZO administration offered the applicant transportation to the Kyiv SIZO in a prison van with a view to his undergoing a further medical examination at the Amosov Cardiology Institute. On 16 June 2017 the applicant refused that offer, arguing that he could not be transported in a prison van owing to his state of health. The case file contains a statement by the applicant dated 16 June 2017 addressed to the head of the SIZO, according to which he did not refuse transportation but insisted on it being in a form that was compatible with his state of health. 15.  Following a further deterioration in the applicant's health, on 22 June 2017 the ambulance took him to the Hospital, where the previous diagnosis (see paragraph 8 above) was confirmed, electrocardiography and cardiac ventriculography tests were recommended, and he was prescribed some medication. 16.  The case file contains an extract from the applicant's medical file bearing no date and signed by the head of the SIZO medical unit; according to the extract, the SIZO had no cardiologist on its staff and high-quality medical treatment was not possible at the SIZO. The applicant did not receive the prescribed medication in full owing to a lack of funds. The extract furthermore stated that he remained under the supervision of the SIZO medical staff and did not require inpatient medical treatment. 17.  On 10 July 2017 the Court reiterated its previous decision (see paragraph 11 above) indicating that the authorities were to ensure that the applicant was transported promptly, and in conditions commensurate with his state of health, to a specialised medical institution to undergo the necessary medical examinations, such as a cardiac ventriculography test, in order that a correct diagnosis could be made and the applicant could receive medical treatment, if necessary. On 8 August 2017 the Government submitted that the applicant had not been transported to a specialised medical institution, as had been indicated by the Court, owing to his refusal of 16 June 2017 (see paragraph 14 above). 18.  According to the available information, from August 2016 until September 2017 the applicant underwent more than fifteen examinations, both within the SIZO and at civilian hospitals, and an ambulance was called twelve times to provide him with urgent treatment. 19.  On an unspecified date the applicant was released from custody. On 7 November 2017 he underwent an examination at the Amosov Cardiology Institute. According to the results of the examination, he was diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, exertional angina (class III), postinfarction cardiosclerosis, and atherosclerosis of the aorta and of the coronary arteries. It was recommended that he undergo surgery for his ischemic heart disease, together with further inpatient treatment. There is no information regarding whether the applicant has undergone the recommended surgery and treatment.

Statute: Article 6 

Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; 
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 6.  The applicant was born in 1934 and lived in Moscow. 7.  In June 1998 he deposited 5,187.40 United States dollars in a three‑month account with Russian Credit, a private bank. 8.  In August 1998 the country suffered a financial crisis, the rouble fell, and the bank defaulted. In December 1998 the applicant accepted the bank's offer to settle and close his account in return for the balance in depreciated roubles. By the time the money reached the applicant in March 1999, the rouble had depreciated further. 9.  In October 1999 the bank went into external administration and its debt repayments were frozen pending a restructuring. 10.  In May 2000 the bank and its creditors negotiated a group settlement of the pre-October 1999 debt and had it approved by the courts. The settlement discharged the bank from fines, penalties, default interest, and damages arising under legislation, contracts with clients, and court decisions. 11.  In December 2001 the applicant sued the bank for the loss caused by the exchange-rate fluctuations between the day he had accepted the bank's offer and the day the money had arrived. The bank objected to that claim on the ground that it had extinguished its obligations by repaying the deposit to the applicant. On 17 April 2002 the Golovinskiy District Court of Moscow awarded the applicant 77,603.50 Russian roubles (RUB)[1]. 12.  In May 2003 the applicant filed a writ of execution with a bailiff. 13.  On 17 June 2003, on the application of the bank, the District Court terminated the enforcement of its judgment in view of the group settlement. The District Court said:
Considering the nature of the legal relationship at issue, the court takes into account the fact that the enforcement proceedings have been instituted with the purpose of collecting from [Russian Credit] the liabilities that had come into existence before 18 October 1999 inclusive and, under the ... terms of the friendly settlement, are related to [the bank's] restructured liabilities subject to novation on the terms of the friendly settlement approved by a [court decision] that had defined the procedure and terms of the extinction of the liabilities.
Pursuant to section 23 § 2 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings, the conclusion of a friendly settlement between a creditor and a debtor constitutes a ground for the termination of the enforcement proceedings, and therefore the [bank's] application shall be granted and the [enforcement proceedings] shall be terminated. 14.  In July 2003, in reply to the applicant's query, the bank's external administrator informed the applicant that his deposit had not been on the books and that under the terms of the group settlement his judgment debt could not be paid. 15.  On 14 August 2003 the Moscow City Court upheld the District Court's decision, finding that the applicant's individual claim was to be settled with the group claim. The City Court said:
When terminating the [enforcement] proceedings the [District Court] has referred to the provisions of section 439 of the Code of Civil Procedure and reached the conclusion that the terms of the said friendly settlement regarding the restructuring of the credit obligations of [Russian Credit] extended also to [the applicant].
The [City Court] agrees with the said conclusion of the [District Court] as based on the provisions of the law and confirmed by the circumstances of the present case.

Explanation: The case presents ambiguity concerning the right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the statute. The fact pattern involves several legal proceedings and decisions that might appear inconsistent or unfair to the applicant, especially regarding the termination of the enforcement of a favorable judgment he obtained and the application of a group settlement to his individual claim without clear explanation or consent. Additionally, the termination of enforcement proceedings based on a group settlement, which the applicant might not have been a part of or agreed to, could raise questions about the fairness of the trial and enforcement process.

Freedom of expression 

1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. 

2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicants, whose names are listed in the appendix, are Turkish nationals. 6.  On 17 and 18 July 2008, each of the applicants sent a letter to the Halfeti (Şanlıurfa) public prosecutor`s office which contained the following passage:
 ""If using the word of ""sayın"" (esteemed) is an offense, then I also say ""Sayın Abdullah Öcalan"", I commit this offense and denounce myself."" 7.  On 19 September 2008, the public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Halfeti Magistrates' Court in Criminal Matters against the applicants. They were charged with praising an offence and offender, prescribed by Article 215 of the Criminal Code (Law no. 5237), on account of their statements in the above mentioned letters. 8.  On 9 March 2009 the Halfeti Magistrates' Court in Criminal Matters found the applicants guilty of praising the imprisoned leader of the PKK, an illegal armed organisation, on account of their statements in the aforementioned letters and accordingly, sentenced them each to two months and fifteen days' imprisonment. In accordance with Article 50 of the Criminal Code, this prison sentence was commuted to a fine of 1,500 Turkish Liras (TRY). 9.  The applicants appealed against this judgment. On 20 June 2012 the Court of Cassation, holding that the amount of the fine that had been imposed on the applicants did not attain the minimum requisite level, dismissed the appeal request.

Protection of property 

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. 

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant company, Virprod-Lux S.R.L., is a company incorporated in Moldova. 6.  On 13 April 2000 the Tax Authority seized a building from a State‑owned company, company V., on account of taxes which were due. 7.  On 1 October 2000, at the request of the Tax Authority, the building was valued by an estate agency at 352,000 Moldovan lei (MDL). 8.  On 29 January 2001 the Department of Privatisation and Administration of State Property sold the building in question to company B. for MDL 360,500 (approximately 29,678 Euros (EUR), following a public auction. 9.  On 25 April 2003 the applicant company bought the building from company B. for MDL 628,000 (approximately EUR 22,053). 10.  On 29 March 2007 the Prosecutor General's Office initiated court proceedings in which it sought the annulment of both the sale of the building on 29 January 2001 and the subsequent transaction between company B. and the applicant company. It also sought the return of the building to its initial owner, company V. The reason relied upon by the Prosecutor's General's Office was that the valuation of the building conducted by the estate agency had not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of the law. The applicant company opposed the Prosecutor General's action and argued, among other things, that it was time-barred. 11.  On 21 August 2007 the Economic Court of Appeal dismissed the Prosecutor General's action as time-barred. The court held, inter alia, that in accordance with the statute of limitations, the Prosecutor General's action could not be initiated more than three years after the events in dispute had taken place. 12.  On 11 October 2007 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld an appeal by the Prosecutor General, reversed the judgment of the Economic Court of Appeal, and upheld the action in its entirety. The Supreme Court considered that the Prosecutor General's action concerned a declaration of the absolute nullity of the contracts in question and that therefore, in accordance with Article 217 of the Civil Code, enacted on 12 June 2003, it could not be limited in time. Following this judgment, the transactions of 29 January 2001 and 25 April 2003 were annulled and each party involved was ordered to return to the other parties whatever they received by virtue of those transactions. 13.  On 7 December 2007 the applicant company lodged a revision request against the above judgment in which it indicated that it had carried out an expert evaluation of the disputed building by an independent expert who determined its value at MDL 8,550,000 (approximately EUR 511,440) after the improvements made by the applicant company to it. 14.  In the meantime, the applicant company did not leave the disputed building because it had its production line there and it needed time and resources to find another suitable building and to move its production line. 15.  Since company V. did not need the disputed building, the applicant company proposed to it and the latter accepted to conclude a friendly settlement agreement in accordance with which company V. agreed that the applicant company would retain ownership of the building in exchange for MDL 325,092 (approximately EUR 19,328). 16.  On 20 March 2008, within the framework of the review proceedings, the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the parties' request to settle the case. It confirmed the friendly settlement agreement between the applicant company and company V., and on that basis it quashed its previous judgment and rejected the Prosecutor General's action. 17.  It is unclear from the materials of the case and the parties' submissions whether after the adoption of the judgment of 11 October 2007 by the Supreme Court of Justice, company B. returned to the applicant company the amount received as a result of the transaction of 25 April 2003.

Explanation: This situation involves various legal complexities and introduces ambiguity regarding the application of the Protocol 1 Article 1 on the protection of property. The timeline of transactions, the different legal decisions made by courts at various levels, the role of the tax authority, and the ultimate settlement between the original and final owner contribute to this ambiguity. Additionally, the question of whether the actions taken (seizure, sale, subsequent transactions, and annulment of those transactions) were in the public interest, in accordance with the law, and whether they impaired the applicant company's right to peaceful enjoyment of its possession is not straightforward. There are also concerns about whether the laws enforced by the state regarding the control and use of property, and the actions taken by the state in securing the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties were justified or not.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Ercsi. 6.  On 28 February 2007 the applicant filed an action with the Székesfehérvár Labour Court against his former employer, claiming unlawful dismissal. On 6 June 2008 the court found in his favour and obliged the respondent to the action to pay him a severance payment, outstanding wages, a lump sum in compensation, and default interest. 7.

Right to an effective remedy 

Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1978. According to the most recently available information, at the time of the events in June 2016 the applicant was detained in Kirovograd pre-trial detention facility no. 14 (""the SIZO""). 5.  In January 2013 the applicant started serving a sentence of ten years' imprisonment for murder. In February 2013 he was placed in Kirovograd prison no. 6 (""the Prison""). 6.  In April 2014 the applicant's health deteriorated. He complained of fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. Following his examination in Kirovograd Regional Hospital, the applicant was diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis (calculi within the gallbladder) and acute chronic gastroduodenitis. 7.  On 11 April 2014 the applicant complained of feeling unwell to the Prison medical unit. He was examined immediately and diagnosed with acute gastroduodenitis and chronic calculous cholecystitis. According to the case-file material, he was not prescribed medical treatment. 8.  On 22 August 2014 the applicant further complained to the Prison medical unit of feeling unwell. He was diagnosed with acute chronic gastroduodenitis and was prescribed dietary treatment for three days. 9.  On 6, 8 and 13 October and 5 November 2014, and 6 March 2015, in response to further complaints by the applicant, he was prescribed outpatient treatment. According to the Government, the outpatient treatment consisted of medicine, which was administered to the applicant in various combinations, notably, papaverine, co-trimixazole, azithromycin, and bromhexin. 10.  Following another such complaint, on 16 April 2015 the Prison doctor diagnosed the applicant with acute chronic gastroduodenitis and recommended that he be further examined at a specialist institution with a view to deciding whether he required surgery. 11.  From 2 to 29 May and from 3 to 11 June 2015 the applicant underwent inpatient treatment for acute chronic gastroduodenitis in the Prison medical unit. According to the Government, he was administered the prescribed medication and his state of health improved. 12.  On 10 July 2015 he was examined by a general practitioner of Kirovograd City Hospital, who confirmed the earlier diagnoses and recommended inpatient treatment and dietary treatment. 13.  From 28 July to 10 September 2015 the applicant underwent inpatient treatment for calculus cholecystitis in unstable remission at the hospital in Bucha prison no. 85. The applicant alleged that the treatment which he had received there had been inadequate and had led to an aggravation of his condition. He also alleged that surgery for his calculus cholecystitis had been scheduled but had not been performed owing to lack of funds. 14.  On 21 September 2015 he was transferred back to the Prison. In the meantime he had been detained in the Kyiv SIZO and the Odessa SIZO. During his detention from 14 to 21 September 2015, he complained to the SIZOs' administration of abdominal pain and vomiting, but allegedly to no avail. 15.  On 8 October 2015 the applicant was placed in a disciplinary cell in the Prison for three months as a penalty for consumption of alcohol. According to the applicant, the conditions of his detention there were very poor: he suffered from lack of fresh air, low temperatures, unsanitary conditions and high humidity. Furthermore, he allegedly had no mattress to sleep on. 16.  According to the Government, on 8 October 2015 the Prison governor issued a decision on the applicant' placement in a disciplinary cell for consumption of alcohol. On 30 December 2015 he was early released from the disciplinary cell. 17.  On 12 October 2015 the applicant's lawyer complained to the Kirovograd regional prosecutor's office that the applicant was not receiving the requisite medical care in detention. He submitted, in particular, that the surgery which the applicant required had been postponed owing to the lack of funds. 18.  On 23 October 2015 the Prison doctor examined the applicant once again and diagnosed him with chronic calculous cholecystitis in unstable remission. He prescribed the applicant medication and recommended elective surgery. 19.  On 9 November 2015 the prison service of Kirovograd Region sent a request for the applicant's placement in the hospital in Bucha prison no. 85. On 9 December 2015 this request was refused owing to the lack of available places in the hospital. 20.  On 11 December 2015 and 16 January 2016 the prison service again requested the applicant's placement in the hospital at correctional colony no. 4 of Dnipropetrovsk Region. On 27 January 2016 the prison service took a decision on the applicant's transfer to the hospital for the required surgery. 21.  On 12 February 2016 the applicant informed the Prison governor that he had refused the treatment offered to him in the hospitals within the Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv SIZOs because of lack of trust in the doctors of those facilities. On the same day the applicant gave his consent to receive treatment at any other medical institution. 22.  On 22 April 2016 following deterioration of his health, the applicant was transferred by ambulance to Kirovograd Regional Hospital, where he was examined by a surgeon and diagnosed with calculous cholecystitis, chronic pancreatitis and ""diffusive changes"" of the liver (дифузні зміни печінки). 23.  According to the Government, as of November 2016 the applicant's state of health was satisfactory. The Government did not provide documentary evidence in respect of that statement. The applicant's rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention were violated.

Right to an effective remedy 

Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.","4.  The applicant was born in 1978. According to the most recently available information, at the time of the events in June 2016 the applicant was detained in Kirovograd pre-trial detention facility no. 14 (""the SIZO""). 5.  In January 2013 the applicant started serving a sentence of ten years' imprisonment for murder. In February 2013 he was placed in Kirovograd prison no. 6 (""the Prison""). 6.  In April 2014 the applicant's health deteriorated. He complained of fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. Following his examination in Kirovograd Regional Hospital, the applicant was diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis (calculi within the gallbladder) and acute chronic gastroduodenitis. 7.  On 11 April 2014 the applicant complained of feeling unwell to the Prison medical unit. He was examined immediately and diagnosed with acute gastroduodenitis and chronic calculous cholecystitis. According to the case-file material, he was not prescribed medical treatment. 8.  On 22 August 2014 the applicant further complained to the Prison medical unit of feeling unwell. He was diagnosed with acute chronic gastroduodenitis and was prescribed dietary treatment for three days. 9.  On 6, 8 and 13 October and 5 November 2014, and 6 March 2015, in response to further complaints by the applicant, he was prescribed outpatient treatment. According to the Government, the outpatient treatment consisted of medicine, which was administered to the applicant in various combinations, notably, papaverine, co-trimixazole, azithromycin, and bromhexin. 10.  Following another such complaint, on 16 April 2015 the Prison doctor diagnosed the applicant with acute chronic gastroduodenitis and recommended that he be further examined at a specialist institution with a view to deciding whether he required surgery. 11.  From 2 to 29 May and from 3 to 11 June 2015 the applicant underwent inpatient treatment for acute chronic gastroduodenitis in the Prison medical unit. According to the Government, he was administered the prescribed medication and his state of health improved. 12.  On 10 July 2015 he was examined by a general practitioner of Kirovograd City Hospital, who confirmed the earlier diagnoses and recommended inpatient treatment and dietary treatment. 13.  From 28 July to 10 September 2015 the applicant underwent inpatient treatment for calculus cholecystitis in unstable remission at the hospital in Bucha prison no. 85. The applicant alleged that the treatment which he had received there had been inadequate and had led to an aggravation of his condition. He also alleged that surgery for his calculus cholecystitis had been scheduled but had not been performed owing to lack of funds. 14.  On 21 September 2015 he was transferred back to the Prison. In the meantime he had been detained in the Kyiv SIZO and the Odessa SIZO. During his detention from 14 to 21 September 2015, he complained to the SIZOs' administration of abdominal pain and vomiting, but allegedly to no avail. 15.  On 8 October 2015 the applicant was placed in a disciplinary cell in the Prison for three months as a penalty for consumption of alcohol. According to the applicant, the conditions of his detention there were very poor: he suffered from lack of fresh air, low temperatures, unsanitary conditions and high humidity. Furthermore, he allegedly had no mattress to sleep on. 16.  According to the Government, on 8 October 2015 the Prison governor issued a decision on the applicant' placement in a disciplinary cell for consumption of alcohol. On 30 December 2015 he was early released from the disciplinary cell. 17.  On 12 October 2015 the applicant's lawyer complained to the Kirovograd regional prosecutor's office that the applicant was not receiving the requisite medical care in detention.

Explanation: The fact pattern illustrates multiple possible violations of the right to an effective remedy under Article 13. The persistent lack of adequate medical treatment for the applicant's chronic health conditions, the delay and eventual refusal of necessary surgery due to lack of funds, inadequate conditions of detention, and the reported inaction in response to the applicant's complaints, all suggest that the applicant may not have had access to an effective remedy for the alleged violations of his rights while in detention. The fact that the complaints and requests for necessary medical treatment were either ignored or inadequately addressed further supports the potential violation of Article 13, as the applicant seems to have been denied an effective remedy before a national authority for the rights and freedoms violated.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2,"The government denied the applicant's requests for effective remedy in terms of treatment multiple times.

Fact pattern: 7.  The applicants are Syrian nationals. Their initials, dates of birth, application numbers and the other details of their cases are set out in the Appendix. At the time of lodging their applications the applicants were detained at detention centres for foreign nationals run by the Federal Migration Service (hereinafter ""the FMS"") in different towns in Russia. 8.  The facts of the cases, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. 9.   On various dates between 2012 and 2016 the applicants came to Russia on various visas and did not leave when the period of their stay had expired. They were apprehended by the police and/or officers of the FMS in various regions in Russia for breaching the applicable immigration regulations, and placed in detention centres for foreigners (see the Appendix for the applicants' dates of detention and details of the relevant proceedings). The domestic courts in the respective regions examined their cases and found the applicants guilty of breaching various immigration regulations. Some of the applicants lodged appeals, but they were rejected by the domestic courts, whereas other applicants eventually had their expulsion orders quashed by the appeal courts. One of the applicants did not appeal against his expulsion order (see the Appendix for the details of individual cases) 10.  All the applicants sought to obtain refugee status and/or temporary asylum in Russia. Some of the applicants voluntarily withdrew their requests and others' requests were rejected, first by the FMS and then by the domestic courts which examined the appeals against the FMS's refusals. Only Y.A.'s request for temporary asylum was granted (see the Appendix for details). 11.  According to the information provided by their lawyers, while the proceedings before the Court were ongoing, six of the applicants (M.S.A., R.K., H.R., B.Z., S.W. and A.A.) left Russia of their own volition on various dates to go to third countries, where they settled (see the Appendix for details). 12.  Between 24 January 2014 and 10 June 2014 M.S.A. and R.K. were detained in a detention centre for foreign nationals run by the FMS in Krasnoye Selo, in the Leningrad Region. 13.  According to their submissions, the centre was based in an eight-storey building with windows covered with grills; five of the storeys were designed to accommodate 176 people in total. Each storey comprised around ten to eleven cells. The centre was severely overcrowded during the whole period of the applicants' detention. In particular, according to a report of the Human Rights Ombudsman in Saint Petersburg, on 26 February 2014 the centre accommodated 400 foreign nationals. 14.  Both applicants were detained in cell no. 511, located on the fifth storey, which measured around 9 square metres and was designed to accommodate six people. All places in the cell were occupied during the whole period of their detention. Thus, each detainee had no more than 1.5 square metres of personal space, despite the statutory requirement that each detainee in a detention centre for foreign nationals have at least 4.5 square metres of personal space. The cell was furnished with three bunk beds and two bedside tables. There was no dining table in the cell. 15.  The food was of poor quality, with no fruit or vegetables, and included pork, which the applicants could not eat for religious reasons. No alternative food was offered instead of pork, so they were deprived of any meal when pork was served. There were no kitchen and dining facilities in the centre. Food was delivered to the centre in containers and served cold in the cells. Detainees were forced to eat on their beds because there were no tables in the cells. This shortage in food was exacerbated by arbitrary restrictions on the contents of food parcels delivered from outside. Detainees were not allowed to receive fermented milk products, home‑cooked food, fruit or vegetables. 16.  Detainees had no free access to drinking water or devices to boil tap water. The cell where M.S.A. and R.K. were detained was only lit by one light bulb, and the detainees were not allowed to switch on the light after 10 p.m. 17.  The applicants and other inmates could move around on that storey to get to sanitary facilities, but they were not allowed to leave the storey or enter other detainees' cells. At the two ends of the common corridor there were bathrooms, each equipped with three lavatories, two washbasins and two showers. The storey was under the control of a dozen ""chosen"" inmates who, with the tacit consent of the centre's administration, dictated their rules to others and created an atmosphere of fear, violence and extortion. One of the bathrooms was for their exclusive use. The other seventy to eighty inmates had to use the other bathroom. 18.  Outdoor exercise was sporadic and lasted around 15-20 minutes. In winter, the applicants did not go outside, as they did not possess winter clothes. In the period April-May 2014 they were able to enjoy outdoor exercise only four times. Outdoor exercise took place in a closed yard measuring around 50 metres in length and 10 metres in width. There was gravel on the ground, and there were no benches, plants or sports equipment. 19.  The facility did not offer any activities, and no library was available. 20.  During the administrative hearing concerning his removal from Russia on 26 February 2016, H.R. was not represented by a lawyer. 21.  According to the lawyer representing B.Z., H.D. and S.W., on 25 March 2015 he was not allowed to meet with them in the detention centre.

Fact pattern: 6.  The first, second and third applicants were born in 1981, 1973 and 1984 respectively. Since 2004 they have been serving life sentences in correctional colonies in Ukraine. 7.  On 11 July 2003 the Ukrainian Parliament adopted the Code on the Execution of Sentences of Ukraine (""the Code""). Article 150 of the Code (""Place of serving life imprisonment"") provided that life prisoners were to serve their sentences in maximum-security correctional colonies. Article 151 (""Procedure for, and conditions of, the execution and serving of life sentences"") further provided, inter alia, that life prisoners were entitled to one short visit every six months. No reference to prisoners' gender was made in those Articles. At the same time, Article 18 (""Correctional colonies"") provided that female life prisoners were to serve their sentences in medium-security colonies. In turn, Article 139 (""Medium-security correctional colonies"") provided that prisoners serving their sentences in such colonies were entitled, inter alia, to have one short visit every month and one long visit every three months. Article 110 specified that a short visit from relatives or other persons could last for up to four hours and a long visit from close relatives could last for up to three days. 8.  By a letter of 27 June 2007 the State Department of Ukraine for the Execution of Sentences informed the second applicant, in reply to a letter sent by him on an earlier date, that female life prisoners were entitled to have one long visit every three months, as provided by Article 139 of the Code, given that they served their sentences in medium-security colonies, as provided by Article 18 of the Code. Referring, in particular, to Article 151 of the Code, the Department further stated that male life prisoners were entitled to have one short visit every six months and that they were not entitled to have long visits. 9.  On 21 January 2010 the Code was amended (""the 2010 amendments""). Article 150, as amended, stated that persons sentenced to life imprisonment were to serve their sentences as follows: male prisoners ‑ either in maximum-security sectors of medium-security correctional colonies or in maximum-security correctional colonies; and female prisoners – either in medium-security sectors of minimum-security correctional colonies with general conditions of detention or in medium-security correctional colonies. Article 151, as amended, stated that life prisoners were entitled to one short visit every three months. A newly introduced Article 151² (""Specifics regarding the serving of sentences by female life prisoners"") provided that female life prisoners were to be placed, as a rule, in medium-security sectors of minimum-security colonies with general conditions of detention. It also provided that female life prisoners were to be subject to the regime laid down for prisoners held in medium‑security colonies (that is, the regime provided for in Article 139 of the Code). 10.  By the Law of 8 April 2014 on the introduction of amendments to the Code relating to the adaptation of status of convicted persons to European standards the Code was amended again (""the 2014 amendments""). Article 151 was amended to entitle all life prisoners to one short visit every month and one long visit every three months regardless of the type of correctional colony in which they were detained or the security regime to which they were subject. 11.  Further amendments to Article 151 of the Code, which were passed by Parliament on 7 September 2016, entitled all life prisoners to one long visit every two months. 12.  The first applicant stated that he and his family had wished to maintain their relationships, but as the result of the absence of the right to long visits until 2014 he had had to divorce his wife. His father, grandfather and grandmother had died in 2008, 2009 and 2014 respectively and he had not been able to see them while serving his sentence. The Government submitted that while serving his sentence the first applicant had received twenty-eight short visits on unspecified dates and fifteen long visits (between 17 March 2015 and 6 July 2018) from his new wife, mother and his other grandmother. 13.  The second applicant stated that, because of the lack of the opportunity to have long visits until 2014, he had lost contact with his family. His relatives had died – in particular he referred to his father having died in 2012 – and when the 2014 amendments entitled him to long visits, there had no longer been anyone to visit him. The Government submitted that while serving his sentence the second applicant had had one short visit in 2005 (from his sister) and had not requested any long visits. 14.  The third applicant stated that, in the absence of the right to long visits until 2014, his right to found a family had been more declaratory than effective as, in particular, he had not been able to have any physical contact in order to conceive children. The Government submitted that while serving his sentence the third applicant had had twelve short visits (between 25 July 2012 and 26 December 2017) and fourteen long visits (between 5 August 2014 and 6 February 2018) from his wife, mother, father and friends.

Explanation: The distinction in treatment between male and female prisoners, particularly regarding the frequency and type of visits they were entitled to under the original and subsequently amended legislation, introduces ambiguity regarding whether this differentiation constitutes discrimination under Article 14. Initially, male life prisoners were entitled to fewer and less frequent visits compared to female life prisoners, indicating a potential discrimination based on gender. Although the legislation evolved to equalize the rights to visits for both male and female life prisoners, the impact of the earlier discrepancies on the applicants, particularly on their family relationships and opportunities to maintain personal contacts, illustrates a substantive issue of differentiation potentially violating the prohibition of discrimination. The true ambiguity lies in whether these legislative differences and their implications align with or violate the principle of non-discrimination as outlined in Article 14, given the lack of clear justification for the initial disparity and its impacts on the applicants' rights.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,The applicants were discriminated on by basis of gender.,FALSE,N/A,incorrect concl,FALSE
