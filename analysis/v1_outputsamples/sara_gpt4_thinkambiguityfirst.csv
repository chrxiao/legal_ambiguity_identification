Statute: It clearly lays out a specific condition under which a tax is imposed on the taxable income of individuals who are neither surviving spouses (as defined in section 2(a)) nor heads of households (as defined in section 2(b)), and who are not married (as defined in section 7703).

Fact pattern: Alice fits the criteria outlined in the statute as she is not married, not a surviving spouse, and not a head of household in 2017.

The events described as happening in 2018 and 2020 cannot be relevant to a current year of 2010 mentioned in the fact pattern. Therefore, the statute's relevance can't be logically assessed based on the provided fact pattern because the key events are described as occurring in the future relative to the stated current year.

- The fact pattern focuses on Alice’s specific deductions for a given year, mentioning both a basic and an additional standard deduction amount.

The fact pattern states that Bob, an employee at the typewriter factory, was given a check (which is considered a medium equivalent to cash) for painting Alice's house, a service not in the course of the employer's trade or business.

False.

In the fact pattern, despite Alice skipping most classes, there is no ambiguity in the statute’s requirements relative to the provided facts. Alice meets the criterion of being enrolled at the university during the time frame in question. The details about her attendance, while potentially relevant for other considerations, do not introduce ambiguity into the reading of the statute based on the information given.

The fact pattern provides information about Alice and Bob's marriage, Alice's death, and Bob beginning the process of marriage with Charlie on December 31st, 2015. However, since the current year is stated as 2014, and the fact pattern discusses events in 2015 which are in the future relative to the current year, there's no direct relevance of these events to the statute's application within the mentioned taxable year (2014).

False. 

There appears to be no inherent ambiguity in this context. The statute explicitly states how tax should be calculated for income over $89,150 but not over $140,000. Alice and her spouse’s taxable income of $103,272 falls squarely within this income bracket.

Regarding whether there is ambiguity in the statute provided when applied to the fact pattern:

False.

Explanation: The statute clearly delineates the tax implications for taxable income ranges. Alice and her spouse's combined taxable income for 2017 is $164,612, which places them within a specific bracket according to the statute provided. The statute outlines the tax calculations for incomes over $89,150 but not over $140,000. Although Alice and her spouse's income exceeds $140,000, the provided statute segment specifically addresses tax calculations for income within a certain range, and the ambiguity that might arise does not pertain to the clarity of the statute in and of itself but rather to its applicability to incomes outside of the specified range. However, without additional context or another segment of the statute addressing incomes above $140,000, one could argue the statute doesn't directly address how to handle the tax for incomes like Alice's, but this is not an ambiguity of language or clarity but rather a lack of provided information.",TRUE,"statute, appl",TRUE,TRUE,both
