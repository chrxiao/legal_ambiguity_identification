Since Charlie, a qualifying child under section 152(c) lived with Bob during this time, it meets the criteria of maintaining a home that constitutes for more than one-half of the taxable year the principal place of abode for a member of the household, which in this case is Charlie.

Explanation: The statute specifies the condition for an additional exemption for a taxpayer's spouse if they are blind as of the close of the taxable year.

The fact pattern states that Alice, the spouse of Bob, has been blind since March 20, 2016, and that Bob is allowed an exemption for Alice under section 151(b) for the year 2017. Although Alice has begun to regain some vision as of November 20, 2017, the statute's application hinges on the definition of ""blind as of the close of the taxable year."" Since Alice began to regain vision before the close of the taxable year, there is ambiguity regarding whether she still qualifies as ""blind"" by the statutory or medical standard at the year-end.

Explanation: The ambiguity in this scenario arises from the specifics of the age requirement, especially the interpretation of ""younger than the taxpayer"" in context with the adoption scenario. Alice, born in 1992, would be 27 years old at the end of 2019, and Bob, born in 1984, would be 35 years old. Although Bob is adopted by Alice and is technically a dependent, the statute highlights that the individual must be ""younger than the taxpayer"" and ""less than 25 years old at the end of the taxable year"" to be considered a qualifying child.

Explanation: The statute defines ""applicable percentage"" based on a formula related to how much a taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds a certain amount.

This situation involves calculations that depend on precise values, and there could be ambiguity in applying the formula (for instance, how to handle fractions of $2,500, how rounding is handled, etc.).

Explanation: The statute focuses on the maintenance of a household as the principal place of abode of the taxpayer's father or mother, with the condition that the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction under section 151 for those parents. In the fact pattern, Bob is maintaining a household for his foster parent, Charlie, not a biological or legally adopted parent. While Bob is entitled to a deduction under section 151 for Charlie, the statute's specific reference to ""father or mother"" introduces ambiguity regarding whether a foster parent qualifies within this definition.

Explanation: The relationship of brother and sister is clearly defined and does not present ambiguity based on the provided statute.

Explanation: The statute references subsection (f) for determining the amounts of additional standard deduction for those who are aged or blind, without specifying the exact amounts or conditions for these deductions. The fact pattern mentions specific additional standard deduction amounts for Alice and Bob based on section 63(f)(1)(A) and 63(f)(1)(B), but without the specific text of those subsections, there's ambiguity regarding the conditions under which these amounts apply, such as age or blindness requirements.

Explanation: The statute requires an entity to have paid wages of $1,500 or more during the calendar year or the preceding calendar year. Both Alice and Bob have paid wages to each other above this threshold within the current year 2017, and Bob's payments to Alice extend into 2018.
