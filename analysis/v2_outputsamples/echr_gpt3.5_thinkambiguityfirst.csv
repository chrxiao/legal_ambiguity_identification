1. We need to check if the applicant's detention falls under one of the specific cases outlined in paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the statute. This includes lawful arrest or detention for reasonable suspicion of committing an offense, preventing the commission of an offense, or spreading infectious diseases, among others.

2. We need to verify if the applicant was promptly informed of the reasons for his arrest and any charges against him, as per paragraph 2 of Article 5.

3. We need to confirm if the applicant was brought promptly before a judge after his arrest and if he was entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial, in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 5.

4. We need to ensure that the applicant had the opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of his detention speedily before a court, as required by paragraph 4 of Article 5.

5. We need to establish whether the applicant would have an enforceable right to compensation if it is found that his arrest or detention was in contravention of the provisions of Article 5, as stated in paragraph 5.

In this case, the legal ambiguity arises from the interpretation of the requirement imposed by TEDAŞ that the security officer must have completed military service, which effectively excluded the female applicant from being appointed to the position. The dispute centers around whether this requirement infringes on the applicant's right to respect for her private and family life as protected by Article 8 of the statute.

The ambiguity lies in whether the requirement of having completed military service for the security officer position is a justifiable interference by a public authority in accordance with the exceptions provided in Article 8, particularly in the interests of national security or the economic well-being of the country. The conflicting decisions by the administrative courts and the Supreme Administrative Court further contribute to the uncertainty regarding the application of the statute to the facts presented.

1. Evaluate if the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's decision to relocate the public schools from the Archdiocese High School building is in the public interest as required by the statute.
2. Consider whether the actions taken by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina are subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law, as stated in the statute.
3. Analyze if the failure to relocate the public school within a reasonable timeframe could be seen as a deprivation of possessions in violation of the right to peaceful enjoyment of property.

Here, the applicant's rights were violated through ill-treatment by police officers, leading to injuries and suffering. The courts awarded compensation, but the question arises as to whether this remedy was effective considering the extent of the violation and the resulting harm suffered by the applicant.

In this case, there is legal ambiguity because the effectiveness of the remedy provided by the national authorities can be questioned given the severity of the ill-treatment suffered by the applicant and the limited compensation awarded. The fact that the applicant's injuries did not cause any ""health damage,"" as mentioned in the judgment, raises concerns about whether the compensation adequately addressed the harm suffered and provided a truly effective remedy as required by the statute.

3. Consider the interpretation of the statute: Consider how the specific actions or conditions in the fact pattern align with the language and intent of Article 3. Assess whether there is a clear violation of the prohibition of torture or inhuman treatment, or if there is room for interpretation.

4. Evaluate the documentation available: Review any additional information or evidence provided in the fact pattern, such as complaints by the applicant and responses by the government, to understand the circumstances surrounding the alleged treatment.

5. Consult legal commentary: If necessary, consult legal commentary, case law, or legal experts to understand how similar situations have been interpreted in the past and whether there is ambiguity in applying the statute to the fact pattern.

Specifically, one would need to assess whether the use of force resulting in the injuries sustained by the applicant falls within the exceptions provided in the statute, such as defense against unlawful violence or lawful actions to prevent harm.

Considering the fact pattern provided, the injuries sustained by the applicant were a result of a bomb attack carried out by a suicide bomber at the airport. The bomber was later found to be part of a militant group, and individuals involved in the attack were arrested and convicted. The applicant brought a civil claim against the airport for damages resulting from security failures.

The legal ambiguity arises in determining whether the injuries sustained by the applicant, as a result of the bomb attack, fall under the exception in Article 2 of the statute regarding the use of force that is absolutely necessary in specific circumstances.

In this case, you would need to focus on whether the applicant's right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, specifically his deposit in the bank, has been adversely affected under the conditions provided in the statute.

Then, you would need to consider how the various events in the fact pattern interact with the protections offered by Protocol 1 Article 1. Specifically, you should evaluate whether the actions taken by the bank, such as the default, the offer to settle in depreciated currency, the subsequent restructuring and settlement, and the termination of enforcement proceedings, comply with the requirements set forth in the statute concerning the deprivation of possessions in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law.

In this case, legal ambiguity may arise if there is uncertainty as to whether the actions of the bank and the courts align with the protections guaranteed by Protocol 1 Article 1. Specifically, ambiguity may exist if it is unclear whether the termination of the enforcement proceedings and the refusal to pay the judgment debt to the applicant are consistent with the applicant's entitlement to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions as outlined in the statute.

2. Analyze the fact pattern: Review the details of the fact pattern to identify any actions or events that may raise concerns related to the right to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence, or the minimum rights of the accused as outlined in Article 6.

3. Assess any potential conflicts: Determine if there are any conflicts or discrepancies between the actions in the fact pattern and the requirements set out in Article 6. Pay particular attention to issues such as the right to legal assistance, the treatment of the accused during police custody, and the validity of statements given under duress.

4. Consider the application of the law: Evaluate whether the actions taken in the fact pattern align with the protections and rights guaranteed under Article 6. Consider any arguments that could be made regarding the fair treatment of the accused and the reliability of evidence obtained through potentially improper means.

In this case, Article 13 provides the right to an effective remedy for individuals whose rights and freedoms as outlined in the Convention have been violated, regardless of whether the violation was committed by individuals acting in an official capacity.

Key points to consider in assessing legal ambiguity include:
1. Identifying the specific rights and freedoms that may have been violated in the fact pattern.
2. Evaluating whether the violations occurred at the hands of individuals acting in an official capacity.
3. Assessing whether the national authorities have provided an effective remedy for the violations suffered by the applicant.

If, after analyzing the fact pattern against these criteria, there is uncertainty or conflicting interpretations as to whether the applicant's rights and freedoms were violated, whether the violations were committed by persons in an official capacity, and whether the national authorities have provided an effective remedy, then there may be legal ambiguity in the application of the statute.

Specifically, you would need to assess whether the arrests and detentions were justified as necessary in a democratic society for national security, public safety, prevention of disorder or crime, or protection of health or morals.

In this case, legal ambiguity may arise if there is uncertainty regarding whether the arrests and detentions were justified under one of the permissible restrictions outlined in Article 11(2) of the statute. If it is unclear whether the authorities had valid reasons to restrict the applicants' right to freedom of assembly, there may be legal ambiguity.

Specifically, we need to assess if the individuals involved were provided with a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, if they were presumed innocent until proven guilty, and if they were granted the minimum rights guaranteed to everyone charged with a criminal offense.

In this case, we would look at whether:
1. The applicants were given a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal at all stages of the proceedings.
2. The applicants were presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law.
3. The applicants were informed promptly and in detail of the nature and cause of the accusation against them.

Given the fact pattern provided, it is evident that the applicant was arrested on 27 December 2010 and was still in custody as of 8 November 2013 when the City Court granted an extension of his detention until 31 March 2014. The applicant claimed that the extensions of his detention were unlawful as the maximum statutory time period had expired.

The legal ambiguity arises in interpreting what constitutes a ""reasonable time"" for trial or release pending trial as per Article 5. While the specific time frames are not explicitly defined in the statute, the applicant's argument regarding the expiry of the statutory time period could hint at ambiguity in the application of this provision to the case. It is unclear whether the prolonged detention of the applicant beyond what he claims to be the legal limit constitutes a violation of his rights under Article 5.
