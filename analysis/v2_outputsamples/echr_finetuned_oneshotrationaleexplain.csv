Right to education 

No person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicants were born in 1993, 1992, 1992, 1994, 1993, 1993, 1995, 1993, 1996, 1994 and 1951 respectively and live in Tighina (Bender). 6.  The applicants are ten pupils of the Romanian (Moldovan) language boarding school in Tighina (Bender) for orphans and other children taken into public care, and their head teacher and also legal guardian, at the time of lodging the application. Not all the applicants are orphans and some of them had sporadic contacts with their parents. The children studied and lived at the school. During the summer holidays, they either went to summer camps or stayed with the families of the school staff. In 2004 the children spent their summer holidays together with the families of school staff. The applicants' school was registered with the Moldovan Ministry of Education and was therefore using the Latin script and a curriculum approved by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Moldova. 7.  According to Article 12 of the Constitution of the ""Moldovan Republic of Trandniestria"" (""MRT""), the official languages within the ""MRT"" are ""Moldavian"", Russian and Ukrainian. Article 6 of the ""MRT"" Law on languages, which was adopted on 8 September 1992, states that, for all purposes, ""Moldavian"" must be written with the Cyrillic alphabet. The ""law"" provides further that use of the Latin alphabet may amount to an offence. In particular Article 200-3 (currently Article 5.28) of the ""MRT"" Code of Administrative Offences states that:
""Failure by persons holding public office and other persons in the executive and State administration, in public associations, as well as in other organisations, regardless of their legal status and form of ownership, and in other entities, situated on the territory of the MRT, to observe MRT's legislation on the functioning of languages on the territory of MRT ... entails liability in the form of a fine which may amount to 50 (fifty) minimal salaries."" 8.  On 18 August 1994 the ""MRT"" authorities forbade the use of the Latin script in schools. By a decision of 21 May 1999, the ""MRT"" ordered that all schools belonging to ""foreign States"" and functioning on ""its"" territory had to register with the ""MRT"" authorities, failing which they would not be recognised and would be deprived of their rights. The registration meant that the schools had to follow the ""MRT"" school curriculum, use the Cyrillic alphabet and learn history in the interpretation of the MRT authorities. 9.  More details about the general background of the facts of the case are described in the Court's judgment in Catan and Others v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia ([GC], nos. 43370/04, 8252/05 and 18454/06, §§ 13‑42, ECHR 2012 (extracts)). 10.  On 4 June 2004 the school administration was informed that the Bender city administration rescinded the utilities contracts because the school had failed to register with ""MRT"" authorities. However, the school was given a new time-limit, until 27 June 2004, to provide ""MRT"" authorities with documents in order to obtain such registration. 11.  The school administration did not comply with the request and on 27 June 2004 the water supply to the school was disconnected. 12.  On 30 June 2004 the Bender city administration requested the school to provide, by 1 July 2004, documents certifying its legal status, its entitlement to use the building and utilities as well as its bank account. 13.  On 5 July 2004 the school was disconnected from the electricity supply. 14.  On 15 July 2004 the Bender city administration issued a decision formally closing the school, because it operated without registration and license. 15.  In the evening of 26 July 2004, unidentified persons and around thirty ""MRT"" militia officers, acting on behalf of the Bender city administration, sealed the school buildings and restricted access to the school area. Russian peacekeeping forces were present but did not intervene. The following day, the children and teachers forcefully re-entered the school dormitory. They were still occupying it when the application was submitted. 16.  On 27 July 2004 the school administration sent a fax to the President of the Russian Federation complaining about the acts of the ""MRT"" authorities which affected 300 children, and about the inaction of Russian peacekeepers on 26 July 2004. 17.  On 4 August 2004 the school was given a new time-limit, until 15 August 2004, to register with the ""MRT"" authorities, otherwise the children risked being transferred by force to a Transdniestrian boarding school for children with disabilities. On 11 August 2004 the ""MRT"" authorities suggested to the school administration that children would have been safer if they were transferred to kindergarten no. 10 in Bender where appropriate living conditions would be available. 18.  The school was disconnected from all utilities and its administration was denied access to the school kitchen or storehouses. From 27 July to 10 August 2004 the Moldovan authorities provided the children with food and water, which was brought to the entrance of the city of Bender, the OSCE mission securing its transportation from there to the school. From 11 August 2004 OSCE employees were not allowed to deliver food and water more than once per day. 19.  On 21 August 2004 the school administration asked the Russian Embassy in Chișinău to intervene in order to remedy the situation of the children deprived of water, electricity and food.

Fact pattern: 7.  The applicants are Syrian nationals. Their initials, dates of birth, application numbers and the other details of their cases are set out in the Appendix. At the time of lodging their applications the applicants were detained at detention centres for foreign nationals run by the Federal Migration Service (hereinafter ""the FMS"") in different towns in Russia. 8.  The facts of the cases, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. 9.   On various dates between 2012 and 2016 the applicants came to Russia on various visas and did not leave when the period of their stay had expired. They were apprehended by the police and/or officers of the FMS in various regions in Russia for breaching the applicable immigration regulations, and placed in detention centres for foreigners (see the Appendix for the applicants' dates of detention and details of the relevant proceedings). The domestic courts in the respective regions examined their cases and found the applicants guilty of breaching various immigration regulations. Some of the applicants lodged appeals, but they were rejected by the domestic courts, whereas other applicants eventually had their expulsion orders quashed by the appeal courts. One of the applicants did not appeal against his expulsion order (see the Appendix for the details of individual cases) 10.  All the applicants sought to obtain refugee status and/or temporary asylum in Russia. Some of the applicants voluntarily withdrew their requests and others' requests were rejected, first by the FMS and then by the domestic courts which examined the appeals against the FMS's refusals. Only Y.A.'s request for temporary asylum was granted (see the Appendix for details). 11.  According to the information provided by their lawyers, while the proceedings before the Court were ongoing, six of the applicants (M.S.A., R.K., H.R., B.Z., S.W. and A.A.) left Russia of their own volition on various dates to go to third countries, where they settled (see the Appendix for details). 12.  Between 24 January 2014 and 10 June 2014 M.S.A. and R.K. were detained in a detention centre for foreign nationals run by the FMS in Krasnoye Selo, in the Leningrad Region. 13.  According to their submissions, the centre was based in an eight-storey building with windows covered with grills; five of the storeys were designed to accommodate 176 people in total. Each storey comprised around ten to eleven cells. The centre was severely overcrowded during the whole period of the applicants' detention. In particular, according to a report of the Human Rights Ombudsman in Saint Petersburg, on 26 February 2014 the centre accommodated 400 foreign nationals. 14.  Both applicants were detained in cell no. 511, located on the fifth storey, which measured around 9 square metres and was designed to accommodate six people. All places in the cell were occupied during the whole period of their detention. Thus, each detainee had no more than 1.5 square metres of personal space, despite the statutory requirement that each detainee in a detention centre for foreign nationals have at least 4.5 square metres of personal space. The cell was furnished with three bunk beds and two bedside tables. There was no dining table in the cell. 15.  The food was of poor quality, with no fruit or vegetables, and included pork, which the applicants could not eat for religious reasons. No alternative food was offered instead of pork, so they were deprived of any meal when pork was served. There were no kitchen and dining facilities in the centre. Food was delivered to the centre in containers and served cold in the cells. Detainees were forced to eat on their beds because there were no tables in the cells. This shortage in food was exacerbated by arbitrary restrictions on the contents of food parcels delivered from outside. Detainees were not allowed to receive fermented milk products, home‑cooked food, fruit or vegetables. 16.  Detainees had no free access to drinking water or devices to boil tap water. The cell where M.S.A. and R.K. were detained was only lit by one light bulb, and the detainees were not allowed to switch on the light after 10 p.m. 17.  The applicants and other inmates could move around on that storey to get to sanitary facilities, but they were not allowed to leave the storey or enter other detainees' cells. At the two ends of the common corridor there were bathrooms, each equipped with three lavatories, two washbasins and two showers. The storey was under the control of a dozen ""chosen"" inmates who, with the tacit consent of the centre's administration, dictated their rules to others and created an atmosphere of fear, violence and extortion. One of the bathrooms was for their exclusive use. The other seventy to eighty inmates had to use the other bathroom. 18.  Outdoor exercise was sporadic and lasted around 15-20 minutes. In winter, the applicants did not go outside, as they did not possess winter clothes. In the period April-May 2014 they were able to enjoy outdoor exercise only four times. Outdoor exercise took place in a closed yard measuring around 50 metres in length and 10 metres in width. There was gravel on the ground, and there were no benches, plants or sports equipment. 19.  The facility did not offer any activities, and no library was available. 20.  During the administrative hearing concerning his removal from Russia on 26 February 2016, H.R. was not represented by a lawyer. 21.  According to the lawyer representing B.Z., H.D. and S.W., on 25 March 2015 he was not allowed to meet with them in the detention centre.

Right to education 

No person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.
Fact pattern: The fact pattern describes a situation where the ""MRT"" authorities in a specific region have imposed restrictions on the usage of the Latin alphabet in schools, and have taken actions against a school for failing to comply with such regulations. The school in question was operating using the Latin script despite the authorities' order to switch to the Cyrillic alphabet. This situation creates legal ambiguity in the application of the right to education under Protocol 1 Article 2 to the fact pattern.

The ambiguity arises from the conflict between the State's obligation to respect the right of parents to ensure education in conformity with their own beliefs, and the actions of the ""MRT"" authorities which restrict the school's ability to operate using the Latin script. The fact pattern does not clearly indicate whether the State is actively involved in enforcing these restrictions or if it is a local authority acting unilaterally. Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that there is legal ambiguity present in the application of the statute to the fact pattern.

In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Moscow. 5.  On 27 August 2002 the applicant brought civil proceedings against the Administration of the Mirninskiy Ulus of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic (""the Administration""), a private person S., her husband B., and a private company A. claiming a title to a flat, damages, and S.'s eviction from the flat. 6.  On 18 September 2002 the Mirninskiy District Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic (""the District Court"") refused to consider his action, because there already had been a decision of 6 February 2001 taken by the District Court concerning the same dispute. 7.  On 13 November 2002 the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic overruled the refusal and remitted the case for a new examination, as the action included a new co-defendant, and, therefore, it could not be said that the dispute was among the same parties. 8.  On 15 January 2003 the District Court ordered eviction of S. and her family from the flat and dismissed the claim against the Administration. 9.  On 3 March 2003 the Supreme Court of the Sakha (Yakutiya) Republic quashed the judgment on appeal and returned the case for a fresh examination, as the lower court had failed to address issues related S.'s property rights. 10.  On 29 July 2003 the District Court ordered an expert examination of the flat in order to determine its market value. 11.  On 14 August 2003 the court proceedings resumed. 12.  In the meantime, the applicant amended his claims and sought to obtain compensation for his belongings allegedly stolen in 1999, non‑pecuniary damage, legal costs, travel expenses and reimbursement of the rent he had to pay after his eviction from the disputed flat back in 1999. 13.  On 29 August 2003 the District Court examined the case, ordered the Administration to pay the applicant 800,000 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of the flat's market value and dismissed the remainder of the claims. In particular, the claim for compensation for the allegedly stolen property was dismissed as unfounded. 14.  On 20 October 2003 the judgment was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court of Sakha (Yakutiya) and entered into force. 15.  On 11 June 2004, upon the applicant's request, the bailiffs initiated the enforcement proceedings. 16.  On 27 August 2004 the District Court granted the Administration's request for suspension of the enforcement of the judgment of 29 August 2003 until 15 January 2005 due to financial difficulties encountered by the debtor. 17.  On 15 November 2004 the applicant's appeal against the above decision was dismissed. 18.  On 18 March 2005 the monetary award in accordance with the judgment of 29 August 2003 was paid to the applicant. 19.  On 29 September 2005, upon the applicant's extraordinary appeal, the Presidium of the Supreme Court of Sakha (Yakutiya) quashed the judgment of 29 August 2003 and the decision of 20 October 2003 and remitted the case for a fresh examination. The Presidium found that the courts had incorrectly applied the material law to various aspects of the case, and had failed to join the appropriate financial body as co-defendant. 20.  It appears that the amounts paid to the applicant under the quashed judgment of 29 August 2003 have not been reclaimed. 21.  On 15 November 2005 the District Court suspended the proceedings, due to B.'s illness and asked the applicant to clarify his claims. 22.  On 21 December 2005 the applicant submitted the amended claims. 23.  On 16 February 2006 the District Court joined, at the defendant's request, the Ministry of Finance as co-defendant in the proceedings and suspended the examination of the case on account of B.'s poor state of health. 24.  On 14 February 2007 the case was assigned to a different judge of the District Court, for the sake of the court's impartiality. 25.  On 21 March 2007 the District Court dismissed the applicant's action. 26.  On 4 June 2007 the Supreme Court of Sakha (Yakutiya) upheld the judgment on appeal except for the parts concerning the eviction of S. and B., reimbursement of the rent, payments for utility services, a commission fee, and recovering of the cost of the apartment. The decision in those parts was remitted for a fresh examination due to failure by the lower court to assess certain evidence and misapplication of the material law. 27.  On 27 August 2007 the District Court suspended the proceedings pending S.'s return from vacation. 28.  On 26 October 2007 the court ordered the applicant to clarify his claims and scheduled a new hearing on 23 November 2007. 29.  On 23 November 2007 the court issued a special writ ordering the bailiffs to obtain clarifications of the claims from the applicant. 30.  It appears that at some point the applicant provided the required information. 31.  On 30 April 2008 the District Court dismissed the action as unfounded. The court explained that the applicant had other remedies to use under the civil law in order to protect his property rights. In particular, he could claim that an equivalent apartment or a compensation be provided to him. 32.  By the final judgment of 13 August 2008 the Supreme Court of Sakha (Yakutiya) upheld the lower court's findings on appeal. 33.  In the meantime, the applicant sued the Administration for statutory interest for the delay in enforcement of the judgment of 29 August 2003. 34.  On 7 February 2007 the District Court discontinued the proceedings as the judgment of 29 August 2003 had been quashed and a new decision in the case had not yet been adopted.

Right to respect for private and family life 

1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 

2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1974 in Khabarovsk and is serving a life sentence in the Sverdlovsk Region. 6.  From 25 May 2012 to 10 April 2014 the applicant was held in penal colony IK-56 in the Sverdlovsk Region. He was able to have five short visits in 2013 and one short visit in 2014. 7.  On 15 July 2013 the applicant asked the governor to allow him a short meeting with four adult relatives, his mother, sister and two cousins. He also asked for the meeting to be held without a glass partition between him and his visitors or the presence of a prison officer. The governor signed his decision on the petition: ""Rejected. Not allowed under the Code of Execution of Sentences"". 8.  From 15 May to 16 July 2014 the applicant was transferred to remand prison SIZO-1 in Khabarovsk – where his family still lived – to take part in another investigation. 9.  On the day after his arrival at the prison, he asked the prison governor to authorise a short meeting with four family members – his sister, two cousins and aunt – without a physical partition between him and the visitors or the presence of prison officers. By a letter of 21 May 2014, the governor rejected his request. He pointed out that, pursuant to section 18 of the Pre‑trial Detention Act, visits are subject to written authorisation from the official or authority in charge of the criminal case. Furthermore, the Rules of Internal Order in Remand Prisons required that visiting rooms be equipped with a physical partition and that visits be supervised by a prison officer. 10.  On 3 June 2014 the applicant asked the governor to authorise a long meeting with his mother and sister. He relied on Article 89 of the Code of Execution of Sentences (CES) and emphasised that the remand prison was equipped with rooms for long-stay visits which could be used by convicted prisoners serving their sentence in that prison. Three days later the governor replied that the applicable law did not make a provision for long-stay visits in respect of remand prisoners. He referred the applicant to Article 77.1 of the CES. 11.  The applicant subsequently asked the authorities in charge of the criminal case to authorise short visits from his family members. On 11 June and 1 August 2014 the investigator and the deputy head of the investigations department, respectively, rejected his request. They informed the applicant that ""the authorities in charge of the investigation were not preventing [him] from having short visits from his family members as long as it did not contradict Russian law, including the Code of Execution of Sentences"". 12.  The applicant challenged the restrictions on family visits before a court of general jurisdiction. According to the information from the Government, all of his challenges were dismissed as unfounded. 13.  According to a certificate issued by the governor on 27 April 2017, the applicant did not have any short or long-stay visits during his time in the Khabarovsk remand prison.

Right to respect for private and family life 

1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 

2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.","5.

From 25 May 2012 to 10 April 2014 the applicant was held in penal colony IK-56 in the Sverdlovsk Region. He was able to have five short visits in 2013 and one short visit in 2014. 7.  On 15 July 2013 the applicant asked the governor to allow him a short meeting with four adult relatives, his mother, sister and two cousins. He also asked for the meeting to be held without a glass partition between him and his visitors or the presence of a prison officer. The governor signed his decision on the petition: ""Rejected. Not allowed under the Code of Execution of Sentences"". 8.

Explanation: There does not appear to be legal ambiguity in the application of Article 8 to the fact pattern. The statute outlines the right to respect for private and family life, but also specifies that such rights can be interfered with by a public authority in certain circumstances, such as for the prevention of disorder or crime, or for the protection of health or morals. In this case, the prison authorities cited specific legal provisions in denying the applicant's requests for visits without a physical partition or without supervision by a prison officer, and these denials were upheld by the courts. The actions taken by the prison authorities appear to be in accordance with the law as specified in the statute.",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2,"The applicant has a right to family life through prison visitation.

Fact pattern: 7.  The applicants are Syrian nationals. Their initials, dates of birth, application numbers and the other details of their cases are set out in the Appendix. At the time of lodging their applications the applicants were detained at detention centres for foreign nationals run by the Federal Migration Service (hereinafter ""the FMS"") in different towns in Russia. 8.  The facts of the cases, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. 9.   On various dates between 2012 and 2016 the applicants came to Russia on various visas and did not leave when the period of their stay had expired. They were apprehended by the police and/or officers of the FMS in various regions in Russia for breaching the applicable immigration regulations, and placed in detention centres for foreigners (see the Appendix for the applicants' dates of detention and details of the relevant proceedings). The domestic courts in the respective regions examined their cases and found the applicants guilty of breaching various immigration regulations. Some of the applicants lodged appeals, but they were rejected by the domestic courts, whereas other applicants eventually had their expulsion orders quashed by the appeal courts. One of the applicants did not appeal against his expulsion order (see the Appendix for the details of individual cases) 10.  All the applicants sought to obtain refugee status and/or temporary asylum in Russia. Some of the applicants voluntarily withdrew their requests and others' requests were rejected, first by the FMS and then by the domestic courts which examined the appeals against the FMS's refusals. Only Y.A.'s request for temporary asylum was granted (see the Appendix for details). 11.  According to the information provided by their lawyers, while the proceedings before the Court were ongoing, six of the applicants (M.S.A., R.K., H.R., B.Z., S.W. and A.A.) left Russia of their own volition on various dates to go to third countries, where they settled (see the Appendix for details). 12.  Between 24 January 2014 and 10 June 2014 M.S.A. and R.K. were detained in a detention centre for foreign nationals run by the FMS in Krasnoye Selo, in the Leningrad Region. 13.  According to their submissions, the centre was based in an eight-storey building with windows covered with grills; five of the storeys were designed to accommodate 176 people in total. Each storey comprised around ten to eleven cells. The centre was severely overcrowded during the whole period of the applicants' detention. In particular, according to a report of the Human Rights Ombudsman in Saint Petersburg, on 26 February 2014 the centre accommodated 400 foreign nationals. 14.  Both applicants were detained in cell no. 511, located on the fifth storey, which measured around 9 square metres and was designed to accommodate six people. All places in the cell were occupied during the whole period of their detention. Thus, each detainee had no more than 1.5 square metres of personal space, despite the statutory requirement that each detainee in a detention centre for foreign nationals have at least 4.5 square metres of personal space. The cell was furnished with three bunk beds and two bedside tables. There was no dining table in the cell. 15.  The food was of poor quality, with no fruit or vegetables, and included pork, which the applicants could not eat for religious reasons. No alternative food was offered instead of pork, so they were deprived of any meal when pork was served. There were no kitchen and dining facilities in the centre. Food was delivered to the centre in containers and served cold in the cells. Detainees were forced to eat on their beds because there were no tables in the cells. This shortage in food was exacerbated by arbitrary restrictions on the contents of food parcels delivered from outside. Detainees were not allowed to receive fermented milk products, home‑cooked food, fruit or vegetables. 16.  Detainees had no free access to drinking water or devices to boil tap water. The cell where M.S.A. and R.K. were detained was only lit by one light bulb, and the detainees were not allowed to switch on the light after 10 p.m. 17.  The applicants and other inmates could move around on that storey to get to sanitary facilities, but they were not allowed to leave the storey or enter other detainees' cells. At the two ends of the common corridor there were bathrooms, each equipped with three lavatories, two washbasins and two showers. The storey was under the control of a dozen ""chosen"" inmates who, with the tacit consent of the centre's administration, dictated their rules to others and created an atmosphere of fear, violence and extortion. One of the bathrooms was for their exclusive use. The other seventy to eighty inmates had to use the other bathroom. 18.  Outdoor exercise was sporadic and lasted around 15-20 minutes. In winter, the applicants did not go outside, as they did not possess winter clothes. In the period April-May 2014 they were able to enjoy outdoor exercise only four times. Outdoor exercise took place in a closed yard measuring around 50 metres in length and 10 metres in width. There was gravel on the ground, and there were no benches, plants or sports equipment. 19.  The facility did not offer any activities, and no library was available. 20.  During the administrative hearing concerning his removal from Russia on 26 February 2016, H.R. was not represented by a lawyer. 21.  According to the lawyer representing B.Z., H.D. and S.W., on 25 March 2015 he was not allowed to meet with them in the detention centre.

Right to an effective remedy 

Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicants' dates of birth and places of residence are listed in the Appendix. 6.  On different dates between 2012 and 2016 (see Appendix) the applicants learned that their right to leave the country had been restricted and that they were no longer allowed to leave Azerbaijan. 7.  It appears from the documents in the case files that in all the cases the restriction in question was imposed by the investigating authorities, in the absence of any judicial decision, within the framework of various criminal proceedings in which the applicants were not convicted, accused or suspected persons, but were only questioned as witnesses. 8.  The travel bans imposed in respect of the applicants in applications nos. 62775/16 and 43327/16 were lifted by the investigating authorities on 29 January and 21 April 2016 respectively. 9.  On various dates the applicants brought an action claiming that the restriction imposed on them was unlawful, either by lodging a complaint with the administrative courts or applying to the ordinary courts for a review of the lawfulness of procedural actions or decisions by the prosecuting authorities under the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter ""judicial review""). Some of the applicants used both of the above-mentioned remedies. 10.  The applicants claimed, in particular, that the domestic law did not provide for the imposition of travel bans on witnesses in criminal proceedings and that the restriction on their right to leave the country was not justified. 11.  In the domestic proceedings relating to all the applications, except application no. 66650/13, the domestic courts refused to examine the applicants' complaint on the merits. Final decisions were adopted on various dates, by the Supreme Court in the administrative proceedings and the Baku Court of Appeal in the proceedings for judicial review (see Appendix). In their decisions, both the administrative and ordinary courts declared that they did not have competence to examine a complaint relating to the lawfulness of travel bans imposed by the investigating authorities. 12.  As regards the applicant in application no. 66650/13, by a decision dated 1 April 2013, a judge at the Sabail District Court dismissed his complaint after examining it on the merits. The relevant part of the decision reads as follows:
""Having assessed all the examined evidence, I conclude that the actions of the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan restricting the right of Mursaliyev Azad Oktay oglu to leave the country are lawful, that the procedure for judicial review as defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Azerbaijan does not provide for a [decision] on the payment of pecuniary or non-pecuniary damages, [and] that, for these reasons, the complaint should not be allowed."" 13.  On 5 April 2013 the applicant in application no. 66650/13 appealed against that decision, reiterating that there was no legal basis for restricting his right to leave the country under domestic law. 14.  On 12 April 2013 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding the first-instance court's decision justified. The appellate court repeated the reasoning provided by the first-instance court and made no mention of the complaint concerning the legal basis for the imposition of the travel ban. The applicants' rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention were violated.

Right to life 

1. Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law. 

2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary: 
(a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence; 
(b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained; 
(c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Moscow. 6.  On 24 January 2011 a bomb attack at the Domodedovo airport killed 37 people and injured more than 160. It was later established that the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber and organised by a militant group operating in the North Caucasus. The applicant, who was present at the airport at the time of explosion, sustained multiple injuries to her body (wounds, contusions and fractures) which provoked further complications (cerebral oedema, coma, respiratory and cardiac insufficiency and a traumatic shock). The applicant's injuries were life-threatening and caused serious harm to her health. 7.  Within the framework of the criminal investigation into the bombing, the investigative authorities arrested four persons. On 11 November 2013 the Moscow Regional Court found them guilty of multiple charges, including commission of an act of terror, organisation of a criminal gang and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Three defendants received life sentence and the fourth one was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. 8.  On 25 November 2014 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the judgment of 11 November 2013 in substance on appeal. 9.  According to the Government, the applicant was granted a victim status. She did not bring a civil action for damages against the convicted persons. 10.  On 25 January 2011 the Russian authorities opened criminal investigation on the charges of negligence against the airport managers and employees and the policemen deployed at the airport. On 22 March 2011 the applicant was granted a victim status in the proceedings. On 5 March 2012 the investigator decided to recall it. On 26 March 2012 the investigator discontinued the proceedings. 11.  On 22 May 2012 the Deputy President of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation quashed the decision of 26 March 2012 and re-opened the case. The proceedings are pending to date. 12.  On 3 June 2013 the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow dismissed the applicant's complaint against the decision of 5 March 2012. 13.  On an unspecified date the applicant brought a civil claim against the airport seeking damages resulting from the failure of the airport security to prevent the bombing. 14.  On 27 August 2013 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow dismissed the applicant's claims for damages. On 16 December 2013 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 27 August 2013 on appeal. The City Court dismissed, inter alia, as unsubstantiated the applicant's allegation that the suicide bomber had been able to enter the airport owing to the lack of a metal detector at one of the airport entrances noting that such fact should have been established in the course of the relevant criminal investigation.

Prohibition of torture 

No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicants were born in 1964 and 1973 respectively and are detained in Corradino Correctional facility, Paola, Malta. 6.  The first applicant is a Venezuelan national who has been detained in Corradino Correctional Facility, Paola, since September 2009. He is serving a ten‑year prison sentence following a judgment of 21 March 2012. Since 10 January 2013 he has been detained in Division 3, cell no. 148. The first applicant has never asked for a transfer because, although there were prospects that he would be transferred to a division with an automated flushing system, this would also have meant that he would lose his individual cell and be placed in a dormitory, to the detriment of his privacy. 7.  The first applicant submitted that his cell has one window and one air vent. The latter is clogged with dirt and debris and his cell window is positioned too high up, meaning that he therefore has to climb onto the sink to open or close it. He stated that the cell does not have adequate ventilation and it is subject to high temperatures in the summer and low temperatures in the winter. He alleged that he had not been provided with a heater during the winter and that his requests to this effect had been turned down. The prison authorities had provided him only with one blanket, other blankets and clothes having been received from NGOs. In the summer, when the temperature ranges between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius, the two fans purchased by the first applicant do not suffice as they merely circulate hot air, which is made worse in the absence of proper ventilation. 8.  He also claimed that he has to use a bucket to flush his toilet. Given the low water pressure, it takes time to fill a bucket and sometimes more than one bucket is necessary to flush the toilet, making the situation deplorable, especially in the summer. 9.  As the building housing the Division is more than 150 years old, the ceiling releases dust, which is allegedly harmful to the first applicant's lungs. 10.  The first applicant submitted that he does not have access to drinking water, since the tap water is rusty and filthy, and he therefore has to purchase drinking water. However, his job in prison pays only 0.60 euro (EUR) cents per day and in the summer he drinks three six packs of water a week, at considerable cost. The Government submitted that the first applicant received EUR 34.77 every four weeks in so‑called ""gratuity"" remuneration and from the ""Work and Pay"" scheme, with which he had been involved since 2015. They stated that at the tuck shop a six‑pack of water cost EUR 2.24 and an individual bottle EUR 0.38. 11.  The second applicant, who is a national of the Dominican Republic, has been detained in Corradino Correctional Facility since 24 November 2009. He is serving a nine-year prison sentence following a judgment of 15 October 2012. Since 27 January 2012 he has been detained in Division 3, cell no. 155 (with the exception of one day ‑ 3 October 2015 ‑ spent in Division 6). 12.  According to the Government, following communication of the complaint, the second applicant was asked whether he wanted to be transferred to another division and replied in the negative. 13.  The second applicant submitted that his cell window is at a height of more than two metres and it is very difficult to open without endangering one's life. Its metal protective bars make it difficult for the cell to admit any natural light. Although there are two openings for the purposes of ventilation, one of them is blocked and there is therefore not sufficient ventilation. 14.  The second applicant alleged that the water is not drinkable; he therefore has to purchase it. The Government submitted that the second applicant received EUR 41.58 every four weeks in so-called ""gratuity remuneration"" and from the ""Work and Pay"" scheme, with which he had become involved prior to 2015. 15.  The dust which falls from the cell's ceiling allegedly affects the second applicant, who suffers from asthma. The Government submitted that the amount of dust falling from the ceiling of his cell was not abnormal, but was what emanates naturally from Maltese stone. They noted that the second applicant had never asked for materials to paint his cell. 16.  The second applicant also submitted that because of the humidity in his cell and the fact that he does not have a heater, he frequently catches the flu during the winter months. The Government submitted that the cell was humid because the second applicant had blocked his vent with a towel and did not undertake any maintenance of his cell. 17.  The second applicant noted that the light both inside and outside the cell is very poor, making it difficult for him to read. The Government noted that the second applicant had a ceiling light and another wall‑mounted light, as well a portable lamp which he had acquired. Natural light came in through three skylights and artificial light was provided through bell lamps of 400W each. The second applicant also claimed that the spiral staircase is not appropriate in the case of an emergency, since a stretcher could not be carried down it and it would not be possible to evacuate people two at a time. In this connection the Government submitted that other options were available should an emergency arise, such as the use of the walkway between the divisions.

They stated that at the tuck shop a six‑pack of water cost EUR 2.24 and an individual bottle EUR 0.38. 11.  The second applicant, who is a national of the Dominican Republic, has been detained in Corradino Correctional Facility since 24 November 2009. He is serving a nine-year prison sentence following a judgment of 15 October 2012. Since 27 January 2012 he has been detained in Division 3, cell no. 155 (with the exception of one day ‑ 3 October 2015 ‑ spent in Division 6). 12.  According to the Government, following communication of the complaint, the second applicant was asked whether he wanted to be transferred to another division and replied in the negative. 13.  The second applicant submitted that his cell window is at a height of more than two metres and it is very difficult to open without endangering one's life. Its metal protective bars make it difficult for the cell to admit any natural light. Although there are two openings for the purposes of ventilation, one of them is blocked and there is therefore not sufficient ventilation. 14.  The second applicant alleged that the water is not drinkable; he therefore has to purchase it. The Government submitted that the second applicant received EUR 41.58 every four weeks in so-called ""gratuity remuneration"" and from the ""Work and Pay"" scheme, with which he had become involved prior to 2015. 15.  The dust which falls from the cell's ceiling allegedly affects the second applicant, who suffers from asthma. The Government submitted that the amount of dust falling from the ceiling of his cell was not abnormal, but was what emanates naturally from Maltese stone. They noted that the second applicant had never asked for materials to paint his cell. 16.  The second applicant also submitted that because of the humidity in his cell and the fact that he does not have a heater, he frequently catches the flu during the winter months. The Government submitted that the cell was humid because the second applicant had blocked his vent with a towel and did not undertake any maintenance of his cell. 17.  The second applicant noted that the light both inside and outside the cell is very poor, making it difficult for him to read. The Government noted that the second applicant had a ceiling light and another wall‑mounted light, as well a portable lamp which he had acquired. Natural light came in through three skylights and artificial light was provided through bell lamps of 400W each. The second applicant also claimed that the spiral staircase is not appropriate in the case of an emergency, since a stretcher could not be carried down it and it would not be possible to evacuate people two at a time. In this connection the Government submitted that other options were available should an emergency arise, such as the use of the walkway between the divisions.","False

There is no legal ambiguity in this fact pattern when applying Article 3 of the statute prohibiting torture.

While these conditions may be considered uncomfortable or substandard, they do not rise to the level of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment as prohibited by Article 3.

Fact pattern: 7.  The applicant was born in 1987 and lived in Syria before he came to Russia in 2015. 8.  The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. 9.  On 23 March 2016 the applicant was arrested for violation of migration rules. On the same day the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Izhevsk (""the district court"") imposed an administrative fine on the applicant and ordered his administrative removal and detention until his removal. 10.  On 5 April 2016 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya excluded the removal order from the administrative penalty imposed on him by the district court. 11.  On 2 June 2016 the applicant was released. 12.  On 3 June 2016 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya re‑opened the applicant's case at the request of the migration official and sent it for re-examination to the district court. 13.  On 16 June 2016 the district court reviewed the administrative removal order of 23 March 2016 and confirmed its validity. The applicant was detained on the same day. On 12 September 2016 the judgment of 16 June 2016 was upheld by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya. On 7 February 2017 the applicant filed a cassation appeal against these three decisions at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. 14.  On 15 July, 7 November and 19 December 2016 and 27 January, 2 March and 10 April 2017 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Izhevsk allowed an application lodged by the bailiff for the postponement of the enforcement of the order of administrative removal by one month owing to the application of an interim measure by the Court on 17 June 2016. The district court granted the bailiff's request having relied on Article 31.5 of the Code of Administrative Offences ((""the CAO""), see paragraph 21 below). In these proceedings the applicant's lawyer also argued that there was a lack of grounds for the applicant's detention and requested that the enforcement proceedings be terminated and that the applicant be released. However, the district court dismissed her arguments, having concluded that,
""the grounds for the applicant's detention had already been established by the court in the removal proceedings and the discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings in the circumstances of [the applicant's] case is not provided for by Article 31.7 of the CAO"" (see paragraph 22 below).
All these decisions, except the one of 15 July 2016 (no appeal was brought), were upheld by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya. 15.  On 17 May 2017 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (""the Supreme Court"") examined the cassation appeal complaint of the applicant and reviewed the judgments issued in respect of his removal (see paragraph 13 above). The Supreme Court confirmed the judgments but discontinued the enforcement of administrative penalty in the form of the removal imposed on the applicant on 23 March 2016. The Supreme Court found that the applicant might be exposed to a risk of torture or ill-treatment in Syria in the event of his return there. On 2 June 2017 the applicant was released (after the decision entered into force). 16.  On 11 May 2016 the applicant's request for refugee status was dismissed. According to the applicant, he did not appeal against this decision because the migration authorities had convinced the applicant that ""his application for temporary asylum would be granted"". 17.  On 4 July 2016 the applicant's request for temporary asylum was dismissed. 18.  On 25 November 2016 a second request lodged by the applicant for temporary asylum was denied by the migration authorities and the applicant did not lodge a complaint against this refusal. 19.  According to the information provided by the applicant's lawyer on 9 November 2017, while the proceedings before the Court were ongoing, the applicant left Russia of his own volition on 2 August 2017 and had settled in Sweden.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Varna. 6.  The applicant and his wife divorced on 21 August 2006 pursuant to a court-approved agreement between the two of them. Under the terms of this agreement, the applicant undertook to pay child support to the two children born during the marriage and agreed to his wife's keeping his family name after the divorce. 7.  Subsequently, the applicant learned that his former wife had conceived their second child, born in 2003, as a result of a relationship with another man during her marriage to the applicant. The applicant underwent a DNA test to determine whether he was the father of the younger child. The DNA test ‒ the result of which the applicant received on 15 January 2007 ‒ established that he was not the biological father of the second child. The results of this DNA test were never considered by a court. 8.  Shortly thereafter, in February 2007, the applicant brought a civil claim in court, seeking to contest his paternity of the child in question. On 1 March 2007 the Varna Regional Court dismissed his request, finding that it was time-barred due to the expiry – in 2004 – of the year-long limitation period counting from the child's birth or from learning thereof (see the section ""Relevant domestic law and practice"" below""). This finding was confirmed by two higher judicial instances, the final decision being pronounced by the Supreme Court of Cassation on 19 September 2007. 9.  The applicant brought subsequent proceedings in which he sought to stop paying child support to the second child. On 20 May 2008 his claim was rejected by the Varna District Court, which found that it had not been proven that the applicant was not the child's father, given that he had not rebutted the legal presumption under Article 32 (1) of the Family Code 1985 (""the 1985 Code"").

On 7 January 2008 the Erzurum public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against fifteen people, including the applicants, charging them with disseminating propaganda in favour of the TKP/ML, under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713). According to the indictment, during the gathering, the second applicant had read out a press declaration containing statements praising the TKP/ML and İbrahim Kaypakkaya, and the following slogans had been chanted by the demonstrators: ""İbrahim is our leader"", ""Our struggle continues and shall continue"", ""İbrahim Kaypakkaya is immortal"", ""Down with the USA"" and ""We will drown fascism in the blood it has shed"". The group had also carried a banner which read ""İbrahim Kaypakkaya is immortal – Partizan""[2]. 7.  On 31 March 2009 the Erzurum Assize Court found the applicants guilty as charged and sentenced each of them to ten months' imprisonment pursuant to section 7(2) of Law no. 3713.

In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in İzmir. 5.  In March 2002, the applicant, who was a working as a civil servant, was dismissed due gross misconduct. He applied to the administrative courts to have the annulment of that decision. In the course of the proceedings, on 4 July 2006 Law no. 5525, granting amnesty to civil servants who had been subjected to disciplinary proceedings, entered into force. Accordingly, in the light of this new amnesty law, on 10 April 2009 the Supreme Administrative Court decided that there was no need to examine the merits of the case. 6.  In the meantime, on 30 September 2005 the criminal proceedings initiated against the applicant had ended with the decision of the criminal court, convicting him of abuse of office. 7.  Following the entry into force of the amnesty law, the applicant applied to the administration and asked to be reinstated. His request was refused on 19 December 2006. The applicant initiated proceedings to have the annulment of that decision. 8.  By a decision dated 8 January 2008, the Ankara Administrative Court found in line with the applicant's claims and decided to annul the decision of the authorities by which they had refused to reinstate the applicant. 9.  Following appeal, the case was transferred before the Supreme Administrative Court. In the course of the proceedings, the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Supreme Administrative Court filed his written opinion. This opinion included substantial grounds on the merits of the case with a proposal to quash the decision of the first instance court. On 25 May 2009, relying also on the opinion of the Chief Public Prosecutor, the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the decision of 8 January 2008. In particular, the appeal court referred to its previous leading case which had been delivered on 17 October 2008 on a similar case and held that the amnesty law did not put an obligation on the administration to reinstate the applicant. 10.  The case was accordingly remitted before the Ankara Administrative Court. On 9 October 2009 the first instance court adhered to the judgment of the appeal court and dismissed the applicant's case. This decision was served on the applicant on 13 November 2009.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Zheleznodorozhnyy, Moscow Region. 6.  The applicant was a locomotive driver with Russian Railways in the Moscow Region. He was a member of one of the railway workers' trade unions, Rosprofzhel (""the trade union""). 7.  On 7 April 2008 the trade union entered into negotiations with Russian Railways, seeking a general pay raise and the introduction of long‑service bonuses for the relevant staff. As the negotiations failed, the trade union decided to organise a strike. On 25 April 2008 the trade union committee decided that the staff of Russian Railways in two suburban Moscow sectors should participate in the strike as from 4 a.m. on 28 April 2008. The trade union committee's decision referred to minimum services which would be provided during the strike, although the parties have not made any submissions in this regard. 8.  Russian Railways did not apply to the courts for the strike to be declared unlawful. On 28 April 2008 the applicant took part in the strike. He came to work but refused to take up his duties. The strike caused delays in circulation of the trains in the sector where the applicant worked. 9.  On 9 July 2008 the applicant was dismissed for two breaches of disciplinary rules. The first breach ascribed to him had had no relation to his trade union activities. (A year previously, on 8 June 2007, the applicant had been officially reprimanded for having stopped the train 50 metres after the platform). The second breach was the applicant's refusal to take up his duties during the strike on 28 April 2008. 10.  The applicant complained to a court that he should not have been dismissed for having participated in the strike organised by his trade union. 11.  On 19 August 2008 the case was heard by the Meschanskiy District Court of Moscow (""the District Court""). The court confirmed the lawfulness of the applicant's dismissal for a repeated failure to properly perform his professional duties. Regarding the applicant's participation in the strike, the court relied on the Railway Acts of 1995 and 2003 (Articles 17 and 26 (2) respectively – see paragraphs 15 and 17 below). The Acts prohibited strikes of railway workers responsible, inter alia, for the circulation of trains, shunting, and services to passengers. The court stressed that those limitations were aimed at securing safety on the railway and that railway workers were subjected to stricter disciplinary rules than workers in other sectors of industry. The applicant was a locomotive driver; therefore, his work was directly linked to the circulation of trains, shunting, and the provision of services to passengers. The District Court concluded that the applicant had been precluded from participating in the strike. Relying on a report dated 29 April 2008 issued by the Moscow Interregional Transport Prosecutor's Office, the District Court furthermore noted that the strike had caused a number of cancelled and delayed trains which had resulted in ""massive violations of the rights and lawful interests of citizens, leading to their belated arrival at their workplaces and educational institutions, at medical facilities providing health care, [and] for long-distance trains, bus runs and flights"". The strike had also ""contributed to the mass gathering of people on railway platforms, which [had] directly threatened their safety"". Given the above and the applicant's earlier transgression, his dismissal had been justified. The District Court did not discuss the question of whether advance notice of the strike had been given or other issues related to the lawfulness of the strike of 28 April 2008. 12.  On 29 January 2009, following an appeal by the applicant, the Moscow City Court confirmed the judgment of 19 August 2008.

The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Zheleznodorozhnyy, Moscow Region. 6.  The applicant was a locomotive driver with Russian Railways in the Moscow Region. He was a member of one of the railway workers' trade unions, Rosprofzhel (""the trade union""). 7.  On 7 April 2008 the trade union entered into negotiations with Russian Railways, seeking a general pay raise and the introduction of long‑service bonuses for the relevant staff. As the negotiations failed, the trade union decided to organise a strike. On 25 April 2008 the trade union committee decided that the staff of Russian Railways in two suburban Moscow sectors should participate in the strike as from 4 a.m. on 28 April 2008. The trade union committee's decision referred to minimum services which would be provided during the strike, although the parties have not made any submissions in this regard. 8.  Russian Railways did not apply to the courts for the strike to be declared unlawful. On 28 April 2008 the applicant took part in the strike. He came to work but refused to take up his duties. The strike caused delays in circulation of the trains in the sector where the applicant worked. 9.  On 9 July 2008 the applicant was dismissed for two breaches of disciplinary rules. The first breach ascribed to him had had no relation to his trade union activities. (A year previously, on 8 June 2007, the applicant had been officially reprimanded for having stopped the train 50 metres after the platform).

While there is a restriction on the right to strike for certain categories of workers involved in transportation services, such as railway workers responsible for the circulation of trains, shunting, and services to passengers, in this case, the applicant was a locomotive driver directly linked to the circulation of trains. Therefore, the restriction imposed by the Railway Acts of 1995 and 2003 on strikes for this category of workers was applicable in the applicant's case.

Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicants were born in 1977 and 1964, respectively, and live in Voronezh. 5.  The applicants are lawyers practicing in Russia. 6.  Between 2008 and 2010 the applicants, within the group of lawyers, consulted several municipal organisations about various legal issues and provided other legal service. However municipal organisations did not pay for the service and the applicants instituted proceedings seeking to recover the debt. 7.  On 22 June 2010 the Sovetskiy District Court of Voronezh granted the applicants claim against the municipal transport company and awarded them 40,020,000 Russian roubles. The judgment was not appealed against and became final. It appears that the judgment was executed at the expense of the municipal budget. 8.  On 9 January 2013 the prosecutor of the Voronezh Region applied to the district court for the extension of the time-limits for an ordinary appeal against the judgment of 22 June 2010. 9.  On 13 June 2013 the district court refused to extend the time-limits. The prosecutor appealed. 10.  On 8 August 2013 the Voronezh Regional Court quashed the decision of the district court and extended the time limit for an ordinary appeal. The court found that the public interest had been concerned as far as the judgment had been executed by means of the municipal budget. Thus the prosecutor had the right to lodge an appeal. 11.  On 12 November 2013 the Voronezh Regional Court granted the appeal lodged by the prosecutor and quashed the judgment of 22 June 2010 and ordered the reversal of execution. The judgment became final and was partially executed.

Fact pattern: 5.  In 1957 several plots of land (agricultural land at the time) were expropriated from the applicants' legal predecessors. The present cases concern restitution proceedings in which the applicants sought that the plots of land, which, at present, form part of a campsite on the shore of Lake Ohrid, be restored to their possession. 6.  On 14 August 2001 the applicants instituted restitution proceedings. On 15 September 2003 the Ministry of Finance's Restitution Commission (""the Restitution Commission"") granted the applicants' claims and awarded them compensation, the form of which was to be determined by a separate decision. It established that according to an urban plan of 20 March 2002 the land was designated as a public green zone in a tourist area. Relying on an on-site inspection (увид) of 1 September 2002, it further held that the land was developed (уреден простор) with access paths and supporting infrastructure. 7.  On 4 December 2003 the applicants appealed, arguing that, inter alia, the land was undeveloped and could be restored to their possession. Were the urban plan to be implemented in the future, the land could be expropriated anew. 8.  On 31 May 2005 the the Second-Instance Administrative-Procedure Commission in the Area of Denationalisation (Комисија за решавање во управна постапка во втор степен од областа на денационализацијата – ""the second-instance commission"") dismissed the applicants' appeal finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and the reasons given by the Restitution Commission. Relying on section 10 of the Restitution Act (see paragraph 15 below), the second-instance commission held that the land in question was of public interest (јавен интерес) and could not be restored to the applicants' possession, but that compensation should be awarded instead. 9.  On 21 September 2005 the applicants lodged an administrative-dispute claim with the Supreme Court reiterating that the land within the campsite was undeveloped and could therefore be restored to their possession. In submissions lodged subsequently, they further referred to decision no. 44-530/1 of 7 March 2006 in which the second-instance commission had accepted a similar claim and ordered that a neighbouring plot of land located within the same campsite had been restored to possession of the claimants. In that case, the second-instance commission had held, unlike in the applicants' case, that access paths and supporting infrastructure had not been sufficient for the land in question to be regarded as developed. 10.  On 7 February 2008 the Administrative Court, which had in the meantime become competent to decide administrative-dispute claims, dismissed the applicants' claim and upheld the findings of the administrative authorities. 11.  On 28 November 2003 the Restitution Commission upheld the applicants' restitution claim and awarded them compensation in State bonds. Relying on an on-site inspection of 13 May 2002 and a certificate of 15 September 2002 issued by the competent Ministry, it established that the plot in question was located within the boundaries of the campsite; that it had been designated as a public green zone and that pedestrian paths and other similar infrastructure were planned for construction. It concluded accordingly that the plot could not be restored to the applicants' possession. 12.  An appeal by the applicants of 7 April 2004 was dismissed by the second-instance commission on 15 November 2005. The latter held that, inter alia, the findings of the Restitution Commission had been based on section 10 of the Restitution Act. 13.  The applicants lodged an administrative-dispute claim in which, alike the applicants in application no. 38024/08, they referred to the second-instance commission's decision no. 44-530/1 and asked the Administrative Court to ensure consistent application of the law. 14.  On 21 April 2008 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicants' claim, finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and the reasoning given by the administrative authorities.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Orhei. 5.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 6.  On 16 January 1997 the Orhei mayor's office attested the property right of a number of private individuals over plots of land in the town. Based on that decision, on 3 April 1997 the same office issued the applicant's brother (C.) title to 0.0569 hectares of land. 7.  On 13 July 1998 C. died. After his death the applicant took possession of the land and used continuously for her own needs. 8.  On 10 September 1999 the territorial cadastre office registered the plot of land as belonging to C. 9.  On 31 January 2000 the Orhei mayor's office amended the annex to its decision of 16 January 1997. C. continued to be mentioned as the owner of the relevant plot of land. 10.  On 15 July 2005 the Orhei mayor's office lodged a civil court action aimed at annulling the property right of C. and the applicant to the relevant land. It claimed that the title had been issued in error since C. had moved to an apartment provided by the town and was no longer eligible to obtain such land. Following this relocation, the cadastre office was supposed to remove C.'s title from the list, which it had failed to do. In the meantime, on an unspecified date the applicant initiated a court action aimed at extending the time-limit for accepting her brother's inheritance. The two court actions were joined by the court on 6 November 2006. 11.  On 15 February 2017 the Orhei district court rejected the court action lodged by the mayor's office and accepted that of the applicant. It noted, inter alia, that the applicant had raised the issue of expiry of the three-year limitation period and added that under Article 78 of the old Civil Code (see paragraph 15 below), the court had to apply the rules concerning the limitation period regardless of the parties' arguments. It found that the mayor's office had missed the three-year limitation period. However, in the operative part the court omitted to refer to the expiry of the limitation period and found that the court action had been groundless. The court also accepted the applicant's action, extending the time-limit for accepting her brother's inheritance since she had taken possession of the relevant land immediately after his death. 12.  On 4 October 2007 the Chișinău Court of Appeal overturned that judgment, accepting the appeal lodged by the mayor's office. It annulled C.'s title to the relevant land, finding that he had obtained it in error and that under the applicable law he could not be the owner of that land. Moreover, the court rejected the applicant's claim for extending the time-limit for accepting her brother's inheritance, finding that she had missed it without a valid reason. 13.  On 12 March 2008 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the judgment of the Chișinău Court of Appeal. 14.  The applicant submitted documents showing that she had paid various taxes for the land in question over the years. 15.  The relevant provisions of the Civil Code (1964, in force before 12 June 2003) reads as follows:
""Article 74.  General limitation periods.
The general limitation period for defending, by a court action, against the breach of a person's rights (prescripția) is of three years ...""
""Article 78.  Mandatory application of the limitation period.
The competent court ... shall apply the limitation period regardless of the parties' request.""
""Article 581.  Acceptance of inheritance.
In order to inherit, the heir must accept the inheritance. ...
It shall be considered that the heir has accepted the inheritance if he/she took actual possession or administration of inheritance assets ..."" 16.  The relevant provisions of the Civil Code (in force from 12 June 2003) read as follows:
""Article 7.  Application of the civil law in time.
(1)  The civil law has no retroactive effect. It does not modify and does not annul the conditions of creation of a legal situation which previously appeared, nor the conditions of ending of a legal situation which previously ended.

It noted, inter alia, that the applicant had raised the issue of expiry of the three-year limitation period and added that under Article 78 of the old Civil Code (see paragraph 15 below), the court had to apply the rules concerning the limitation period regardless of the parties' arguments. It found that the mayor's office had missed the three-year limitation period. However, in the operative part the court omitted to refer to the expiry of the limitation period and found that the court action had been groundless. The court also accepted the applicant's action, extending the time-limit for accepting her brother's inheritance since she had taken possession of the relevant land immediately after his death. 12.  On 4 October 2007 the Chișinău Court of Appeal overturned that judgment, accepting the appeal lodged by the mayor's office. It annulled C.'s title to the relevant land, finding that he had obtained it in error and that under the applicable law he could not be the owner of that land. Moreover, the court rejected the applicant's claim for extending the time-limit for accepting her brother's inheritance, finding that she had missed it without a valid reason. 13.  On 12 March 2008 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the judgment of the Chișinău Court of Appeal. 14.  The applicant submitted documents showing that she had paid various taxes for the land in question over the years. 15.  The relevant provisions of the Civil Code (1964, in force before 12 June 2003) reads as follows:
""Article 74.  General limitation periods.
The general limitation period for defending, by a court action, against the breach of a person's rights (prescripția) is of three years ...""
""Article 78.  Mandatory application of the limitation period.
The competent court ... shall apply the limitation period regardless of the parties' request.""
""Article 581.  Acceptance of inheritance.
In order to inherit, the heir must accept the inheritance. ...
It shall be considered that the heir has accepted the inheritance if he/she took actual possession or administration of inheritance assets ..."" 16.  The relevant provisions of the Civil Code (in force from 12 June 2003) read as follows:
""Article 7.  Application of the civil law in time.
(1)  The civil law has no retroactive effect. It does not modify and does not annul the conditions of creation of a legal situation which previously appeared, nor the conditions of ending of a legal situation which previously ended.
...
(6)  The provisions of the new law concerning limitation periods ... shall apply to limitation periods which started before the date of entry into force of the new law, but did not end before that date. ... The start, the suspension and the interruption of the limitation period shall be determined under the old law for the period before the entry into force of the new law.

In this fact pattern, there does not appear to be any legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the situation described. The case involves a dispute over property rights and inheritance, which falls within the scope of civil law rather than criminal law. The right to a fair trial outlined in Article 6 pertains specifically to criminal charges, and as such, it is not directly applicable to this civil case. The dispute here revolves around property ownership, title issuance, and inheritance acceptance, which are governed by civil law principles.

Protection of property 

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. 

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicants are Russian nationals. They were owners of flats in Moscow. The municipal authorities reclaimed the flats, and the applicants' title to the real property in question was annulled. 5.  In 1977 a number of flats in a residential building located at 15-3 Ulitsa Tsyurupy, Moscow, were assigned by the City of Moscow to the Ministry of Communications. The flats were used as temporary housing for foreign specialists seconded to the Ministry. In 1991 the flats were transferred to the Rostelekom Open Joint Stock Company, the Ministry's successor. On 18 February 2009 the flats were transferred from Rostelekom to the City of Moscow. It appears that the flats remained vacant. 6.  In 2008-2009 a group of people, including a police officer, a lawyer, a notary and several Rostelekom employees, forged documents pertaining to three flats located at 15-3 Ulitsa Tsyurupy, Moscow, showing that the flats were owned by private individuals and, following their deaths, were inherited by their ""heirs"". The relevant property deeds were forged by notary K. and then registered by the City Registration Department. Then the ""heirs"" sold the flats to private parties. Subsequently the flats were bought by the applicants. Each transaction with the flats was reviewed and approved by the City Registration Department. 7.  On 8 August 2012 a criminal investigation was opened into the City's loss of title to the flats. 8.  On 7 December 2012 the Housing Department of the City of Moscow (the ""Housing Department"") was recognised as a victim of the crime. 9.  On 9 December 2013 the Perovskiy District Court of Moscow found nine defendants, including several Rostelekom employees, guilty of fraud. The court established, inter alia, that the defendants had forged the documents and had had unlawfully registered the flats as private property to the detriment of the City of Moscow. Notary K. was questioned as a witness. 10.  On 11 March 2014 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 9 December 2013 on appeal. 11.  According to the Government, notary K. was also found guilty of fraud and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 12.  In 2014 the Housing Department brought civil actions seeking restitution of the flats. 13.  The Cheremushkinskiy District Court of Moscow granted the Housing Department's claims. The court invalidated the transactions in respect of the flats and the applicants' title to the flats and ordered their eviction. The court applied the domestic law provisions which allowed the owner to recover its property from a bona fide purchaser if the said property left the owner's possession against its will. The court considered that the City of Moscow had not had intent to divest itself of the flats and had a right to recover the stolen flats from the applicants. 14.  The Moscow City Court upheld the judgments of the District Court on appeal. As regards Ms Titova (application nos. 4919/16), the City Court discerned no evidence in the material of the case file that would substantiate her claim that she had bought the flat in good faith. The City Court took into account that she had bought the flat a month and a half after the previous transaction and that the purchase price of the flat had been obviously lower than its market value. In the City Court's view, Ms Titova, if having acted with due care and diligence, should have had doubts as to the legitimacy of seller's title and sale of the flat. 15.  Subsequently, the City Court refused to grant the applicants leave to bring a cassation appeal against the judgments in their respective cases. 16.  According to the Government, the applicants were not evicted and continue to reside in the flats. 17.  The details pertaining to each case are summed up in Appendix II below.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Klaipėda. 5.  On 2 July 2013 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with intention to distribute. On 9 July 2013 the applicant was brought to Šiauliai Remand Prison and was held there until 31 May 2016. In judgment of 23 December 2015 the applicant was sentenced to four years imprisonment by the Klaipėda District Court. Following an appeal by the applicant, the judgment became final on 25 May 2016. The applicant was then transferred to Alytus Correctional Facility and after serving his sentence was released on 30 June 2017. 6.  In April 2014 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Šiauliai Regional Administrative Court about his conditions of detention in Šiauliai Remand Prison. He complained of: overcrowding; of there being no partition wall between toilets and cells; of insufficient ventilation; of insufficient time in the open air; of insufficient time for showering; of the presence of cockroaches; of inmates smoking in the cells; of no long-stay or short visits; of the fact that he had not been allowed to go home; of the low energy value of the food provided; of the prohibition on receiving food from relatives and friends; and of the prohibition on having his own blanket and a music player. 7.  On 27 June 2014 the Šiauliai Regional Administrative Court held that for 135 days the applicant had been housed in cell no. 53, and the personal space available to him had varied between 1.87 and 3.12 sq. m. This had been a clear violation of domestic norms. For eighty-seven days the applicant had been held in cell no. 50, where the personal space available to him had varied between 1.86 and 4.65 sq. m, and it had come close to a violation of domestic norms. The court further held that the presence of toilets in the applicant's cell had not corresponded to the requirements of domestic law, that the lighting had been insufficient and the temperature had been too low, and that the food provided had had insufficient energy value. The court noted that inmates could buy food and other necessities in the shops of the facility. The applicant's other complaints were dismissed as unsubstantiated. As regards the prohibition on having his own blanket and a music player, the court held that the use of personal blankets was not allowed in accordance with domestic norms. As for music players, inmates could use television sets, computers, computer-game devices, discs that could not be rewritten, other memory cards of up to 4GB and bedding (except for a pillow, a mattress and a blanket) that could be given to them by their spouses, partners or close relatives. As regards long-stay and short visits, the court held that remand prisoners did not have a right to long-stay visits but he had a right to short visits of up to two hours. The applicant asked for a long-stay visit but on 20 January 2014 the prosecutor decided not to allow him such a visit. The court also held that inmates could be allowed to go home for up to five days in the event of the death or serious illness of a spouse, partner or close relative, or in the event of a natural disaster that had caused serious pecuniary damage to the inmate, his or her spouse, partner or close relatives. However, in his request of 31 January 2014 the applicant did not indicate any of those circumstances. As a result, the applicant was awarded 1,200 Lithuanian litai (LTL – approximately 348 euros (EUR)) in compensation for inadequate material conditions of detention for 222 days during the period between 9 July 2013 and 3 April 2014. 8.  The applicant appealed, and on 11 February 2015 the Supreme Administrative Court held that it was impossible to calculate for how many days the applicant had had sufficient personal space at his disposal, and decided to hold that for 245 days the applicant had not had sufficient personal space, and that this had been a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The court thus decided to increase the compensation to EUR 1,500. 9.  In October 2014 the applicant lodged a new complaint concerning his material conditions in Šiauliai Remand Prison. He complained of overcrowding, low temperature, dampness, insufficient lighting, prisoners smoking in the cells, that his partner had not been able to pay him a long‑stay visit and that he had not been allowed to ""take holidays"". It appears that the applicant had asked the prison management to allow him to receive a long-stay visit from his spouse and his sister on 28 April 2014. 10.  On 5 December 2014 the Šiauliai Regional Administrative Court held that during the period between 4 April and 5 October 2014 – for 176 days – the applicant had had insufficient cell space. As regards long-stay visits, the court agreed with Šiauliai Remand Prison and stated that the applicant had not been entitled to them under domestic law; he could have had short visits but, however, he had never asked for them. The court accepted the argument of the Šiauliai Remand Prison that remand detainees had been held in prisons or correctional facilities for short periods of time and they were not in a similar situation to convicted inmates. The court awarded the applicant EUR 869 in compensation for the material conditions of his detention. 11.  The applicant appealed, and on 21 September 2015 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the first-instance decision in its entirety. The applicant's rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention were violated.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Oryol. He is currently serving his sentence in IK-7 in the village of Areyskoye, Krasnoyarsk Region. 6.  The applicant, his partner and his mother were living in Oryol when the applicant was charged with drug-related crimes. 7.  On 2 December 2009 the Federal Penal Authority (""Федеральная служба исполнения наказаний"", ""the FSIN"") of Russia sent a telegram to the FSIN department for the Oryol Region (""the Oryol FSIN"") instructing the latter to send each month up to forty people detained in remand prisons and sentenced to a term of imprisonment in a strict-regime facility to the Krasnoyarsk Region. The instruction was valid as of 1 December 2009 until further notice. 8.  On 7 December 2009 the Sovetskiy District Court of Oryol convicted the applicant of drug-related crimes and sentenced him to twelve years' imprisonment in a strict-regime post-conviction detention facility. On 2 February 2010 the Oryol Regional Court upheld the conviction on appeal. 9.  Acting on the basis of the FSIN of Russia's instruction of 2 December 2009, on an unspecified date the Oryol FSIN decided, in view of the overcrowding in the post‑conviction detention facilities in the Oryol Region, that the issue of which particular facility the applicant would be transferred to should be resolved by the FSIN department for the Krasnoyarsk Region (""the Krasnoyarsk FSIN""). The latter allocated the applicant to IK-7, a strict-regime post-conviction detention facility in the village of Areyskoye, Krasnoyarsk Region (about 4,200 km from Oryol), to serve his sentence. The applicant has been detained there since 20 April 2010. 10.  The applicant has repeatedly asked the penal authorities at different levels to transfer him to a detention facility located closer to Oryol so that he could effectively maintain family ties while serving his sentence. 11.  On 12 November 2010 the FSIN of Russia rejected the applicant's request, informing him that, under Article 81 of the Code on the Execution of Sentences (""the CES""), in the absence of exceptional circumstances convicts were to serve their prison term in its entirety in the same detention facility, and that there were no such exceptional circumstances in the applicant's case. They noted as follows:
""[a]s regards maintaining the convict's social ties, the right to receive visits and parcels as well as the right to correspondence and phone calls should be realised in accordance with the laws on execution of sentences in force and does not depend on the place in which he is serving the sentence."" 12.  The applicant brought civil proceedings against the Oryol FSIN, claiming compensation for pecuniary and non‑pecuniary damage caused by their decision to transfer him to a penal facility in the Krasnoyarsk Region in breach of his right, under Article 73 § 1 of the CES, to serve his prison sentence in his home region, which had adversely affected his capacity to maintain his family and social ties. 13.  On 3 August 2012 the Zavodskoy District Court of Oryol dismissed the claims for damages with reference to Article 73 § 2 of the CES and Ruling No. 1700-O-O of the Constitutional Court of Russia. The court held that the Oryol FSIN's decision had been lawful because between December 2009 and February 2010 the penal facilities in the Oryol Region had been overcrowded. It also noted that the defendant had acted in accordance with the FSIN of Russia's instructions. The court did not address the applicant's argument regarding his difficulties in maintaining family ties because of the distance between his family home and the detention facility. It appears that the applicant did not appeal against the judgment. 14.  Between July 2011 and October 2013 the applicant's partner made long-term family visits to IK-7 on six occasions. In 2014 she gave birth to the couple's daughter. While in IK-7, the applicant received a number of parcels and phone calls from his mother and partner. The applicant's rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention were violated.

Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; 
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Zagreb. He was formerly a lawyer practising in Zagreb. 6.  In the context of the use of secret surveillance measures in respect of a vice-president of the Croatian Privatisation Fund (Hrvatski fond za privatizaciju, hereinafter ""the Fund""), a legal entity established by the State and tasked with carrying out the privatisation of publicly owned property, the authorities intercepted and recorded a number of the applicant's telephone conversations and messages. The secret surveillance was carried out on the basis of orders issued by an investigating judge of the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu). The reasoning of the relevant orders is outlined in the case of Matanović v. Croatia (no. 2742/12, §§ 11‑13, 4 April 2017). 7.  On 16 June 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of corruption involving a number of officials of the Fund and other individuals. 8.  Following his arrest, an investigation was opened in the Zagreb County Court (see, for further details, Matanović, cited above, §§ 15-28). 9.  On 12 February 2008, upon completion of the investigation, the State Attorney's Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime (Ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta – hereinafter: ""the State Attorney's Office"") indicted the applicant and nine other individuals in the Zagreb County Court on charges of bribe-taking, offering bribes, and abuse of power and authority. The applicant was indicted ‒ in his capacity as the lawyer acting for the Vice-President of the Fund ‒ for facilitating the receipt of a bribe of 150,000 euros (EUR) for his client and aiding and abetting the abuse of power and authority by him. 10.  During the proceedings the applicant challenged the lawfulness of the secret surveillance orders, arguing that they lacked the requisite reasoning and had been issued contrary to the provisions of the relevant domestic law (see, for further details on the procedural actions taken, Matanović, cited above, §§ 29-63). 11.  On 15 May 2009 the Zagreb County Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. It examined in detail and dismissed the applicant's arguments regarding the unlawfulness of secret surveillance orders on the grounds that they had been issued by the relevant investigating judge in accordance with the law. The trial court also provided detailed reasoning why it considered that the available evidence provided a reliable basis for the applicant's conviction. When convicting the applicant, the trial court had relied on the secret surveillance recordings, the statement of an informant, who had been questioned at the trial, the statements of other witnesses, and the evidentiary material available in the file. 12.  On 24 and 28 September 2009, the applicant both personally and through a lawyer lodged appeals against the first-instance judgment before the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske). In the appeals, the applicant argued that he had been unlawfully monitored and that his conviction had been based on evidence obtained unlawfully by the use of secret surveillance. He also extensively challenged the factual findings and conclusions of the first-instance court. 13.  On 17 February 2010 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's appeal as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the first-instance judgment. 14.  On 22 April 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) alleging in particular that he had been placed under unlawful secret surveillance and that the evidence thereby obtained had been used in the criminal proceedings against him. He also extensively elaborated on the alleged deficiencies in the lower courts' factual conclusions. 15.  On 21 February 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant's complaints as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts. It also stressed that the applicant had actively participated in the proceedings and that there had been no arbitrariness in the findings and decisions of the relevant courts. 16.  The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant's representative on 23 February 2012.

On 12 February 2008, upon completion of the investigation, the State Attorney's Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime (Ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta – hereinafter: ""the State Attorney's Office"") indicted the applicant and nine other individuals in the Zagreb County Court on charges of bribe-taking, offering bribes, and abuse of power and authority. The applicant was indicted ‒ in his capacity as the lawyer acting for the Vice-President of the Fund ‒ for facilitating the receipt of a bribe of 150,000 euros (EUR) for his client and aiding and abetting the abuse of power and authority by him. 10.  During the proceedings the applicant challenged the lawfulness of the secret surveillance orders, arguing that they lacked the requisite reasoning and had been issued contrary to the provisions of the relevant domestic law (see, for further details on the procedural actions taken, Matanović, cited above, §§ 29-63). 11.  On 15 May 2009 the Zagreb County Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. It examined in detail and dismissed the applicant's arguments regarding the unlawfulness of secret surveillance orders on the grounds that they had been issued by the relevant investigating judge in accordance with the law. The trial court also provided detailed reasoning why it considered that the available evidence provided a reliable basis for the applicant's conviction. When convicting the applicant, the trial court had relied on the secret surveillance recordings, the statement of an informant, who had been questioned at the trial, the statements of other witnesses, and the evidentiary material available in the file. 12.  On 24 and 28 September 2009, the applicant both personally and through a lawyer lodged appeals against the first-instance judgment before the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske). In the appeals, the applicant argued that he had been unlawfully monitored and that his conviction had been based on evidence obtained unlawfully by the use of secret surveillance. He also extensively challenged the factual findings and conclusions of the first-instance court. 13.  On 17 February 2010 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's appeal as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the first-instance judgment. 14.  On 22 April 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) alleging in particular that he had been placed under unlawful secret surveillance and that the evidence thereby obtained had been used in the criminal proceedings against him. He also extensively elaborated on the alleged deficiencies in the lower courts' factual conclusions. 15.  On 21 February 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant's complaints as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts. It also stressed that the applicant had actively participated in the proceedings and that there had been no arbitrariness in the findings and decisions of the relevant courts. 16.  The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant's representative on 23 February 2012.","False

Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; 
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 5.  On 23 December 2004 the applicants and 126 others lodged a claim with the Komárno Land Office, an authority that is now part of the Komárno District Office (""the Land Office""), for restitution of land under the Restoration of Land Ownership Act (Law no. 503/2003 Coll., as amended). 6.  On 27 May 2010 the Land Office dismissed the claim on the grounds that all the claimants lacked standing to bring it. 7.  On 21 November 2011 the Nitra Regional Court upheld that decision following an administrative-law appeal by the claimants, lodged on their behalf by four individuals. 8.  However, following an appeal lodged by the claimants with the Supreme Court, on 29 January 2014 that court quashed the Regional Court's judgment and remitted the case to it on the grounds that the latter had failed to establish the representatives' authority to act on behalf of all the claimants. The proceedings before the Regional Court had been conducted merely in the presence of the designated representatives and the court had failed to summon the claimants in person and to have its judgment served on them. It had thereby breached the claimants' right of access to a court. 9.  Accordingly, it became incumbent on the Regional Court to determine anew the claimants' administrative-law appeal against the decision of the Land Office of 27 May 2010. In those proceedings, the court invited the claimants to clarify issues concerning their legal representation with a view to ensuring that they would be represented by a common representative. 10.  In a decision of 4 December 2014 the Regional Court issued several rulings. In so far as relevant for the present application, it ruled that the claimants would all be jointly represented by a lawyer who had up until then represented only some of them. 11.  On 25 May 2016 the Supreme Court upheld the decision of 4 December 2014 following an appeal lodged by the claimants. 12.  The proceedings are still pending before the Regional Court. 13.  Meanwhile, on 21 January 2015 the Constitutional Court had rejected a complaint lodged by the applicants about the length of the proceedings in their claim, in so far as they had taken place before the Land Office and the Regional Court. The Constitutional Court held that the length of the administrative proceedings before the Land Office and of the judicial‑review proceedings held before the Regional Court could not be considered together.
Having split the complaint into those two segments, the Constitutional Court rejected the complaint concerning the administrative proceedings on the grounds of non-exhaustion of ordinary remedies. In particular, it noted that the applicants had failed to challenge the alleged inactivity of the Land Office under Article 250t § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) (see paragraphs 19 et seq. in ""Relevant domestic law and practice"" below).
As regards the judicial-review proceedings, the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint as manifestly ill-founded. It noted that those proceedings as a whole had lasted some four and a half years. However, the case had been pending on appeal before the Supreme Court for about two years of that period. Although the length of the appellate proceedings had been unsatisfactory, as such it had not been complained of by the applicants, who had limited their compliant to the proceedings before the Regional Court. In addition, the Constitutional Court observed that the proceedings had been procedurally complex on account of the number of claimants. In sum, despite the fact that its judgment had been quashed as flawed, the length of the proceedings before the Regional Court had not been excessive.

A: True
Explanation: While it depends on the definition of ""reasonable time,"" it appears, with the multiple closings and reopenings, that the applicant did not receive a hearing within a reasonable time, as it took more than a year. At the same time, the Constitutional Court ruled that the length of proceedings was not excessive.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Batumi. 6.  He was a judge at the Khulo District Court. On 12 November 2004 the Supreme Council of Justice initiated disciplinary proceedings against him on the grounds set out in section 2(2)-(a) Act of 22 February 2000 on Disciplinary Proceedings against Judges of Ordinary Courts (hereinafter, ""the Disciplinary Proceedings Act"" – see paragraphs 16 and 17 below). He was accused in particular of having kept a defendant in a criminal case under his consideration in unlawful detention for the period of fourteen days in September 2004, which fact was qualified as a ""manifest breach of the law"" within the meaning of the above-mentioned provision of the Disciplinary Proceedings Act. 7.  On 18 November 2004 a Panel of the Disciplinary Council of Judges (hereinafter, ""the Panel""), composed of Mr K.K. (the President of the Panel and rapporteur), Mr G.Ch., Mr D.S. and Mr I.K., considered the case at an oral hearing. According to the transcript of the hearing, the applicant admitted to the act he had been accused of. After examining the circumstances of the case, the Panel found the applicant guilty of the misconduct in question. Describing the mistake at issue as unacceptable, the Panel decided, despite his lack of prior disciplinary sanctions and his good professional reputation, to remove the applicant from judicial office. 8.  The applicant lodged an appeal with the Disciplinary Council of Judges (hereinafter, ""the Disciplinary Council"") on points of fact and law. He questioned the assessment of the circumstances of the case and the application of the legal provisions to the established facts in the decision of 18 November 2004. 9.  By a decision of 27 January 2005, the Disciplinary Council unanimously upheld the Panel's decision of 18 November 2004 in its entirety. 10.  The applicant appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court of Georgia. In a judgment of 11 July 2005, the Supreme Court quashed the Disciplinary Council's decision of 27 January 2005 for lack of reasoning and legal assessment of the facts, and remitted the case for re-examination. 11.  On 4 August 2005 the Disciplinary Council, composed of six members, including three members, Mr K.K. (President and rapporteur), Mr G.Ch., Mr I.K, who had sat at the first hearing, re-considered the applicant's case; another member of the Disciplinary Council who participated in the examination of the applicant's case was Ms N.K. During the oral hearing, the applicant challenged the above-mentioned three members of the bench – Mr K.K., Mr G.Ch. and Mr I.K – on the ground that they had considered his case when it had come before the Panel on 18 November 2004. The request was dismissed. 12.  After re-considering all the factual circumstances of the case, the Disciplinary Council found, in its decision of 4 August 2005, that the applicant had committed ""a manifest breach of the law"" and upheld the Panel's decision of 18 November 2004 in its entirety. 13.  In his appeal on points of law, the applicant complained that Mr K.K. had presided over all of the benches of both the Disciplinary Council and the Panel, and three of the members sitting on the Disciplinary Council when it ruled on 4 August 2005 had already dealt with the case at first instance on 18 November 2004. He also complained about his request for their withdrawal being rejected. Finally, the applicant criticised the haste with which the case had been considered by the Disciplinary Council. 14.  On 14 November 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's appeal on points of law, finding that the case had been objectively and exhaustively examined by the disciplinary bodies and that the punishment imposed had been appropriate. As for the rest, noting that the Disciplinary Proceedings Act had instituted a system whereby members of the disciplinary panel could also sit on the Disciplinary Council, the Supreme Court concluded that the composition of the benches complained of by the applicant had been perfectly legal. Moreover, in the court's opinion, the fact that the persons concerned had previously participated in the examination of the case was not in itself sufficient to prove that the Disciplinary Council, in its ruling on 4 August 2005, had not been impartial. 15.  According to the materials available in the case file, the applicant did not voice, even in remote terms, either before the Panel, the Disciplinary Council or the Supreme Court any complaint about the lack of professional qualifications by any of the individual members of the Disciplinary Council who had participated in the examination of his case.

The right to a fair trial includes the right to be judged by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. In this case, there is a potential legal ambiguity regarding the composition of the Disciplinary Council that decided on the applicant's case.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Dubno. 6.  The applicant was the principal of a private school in the town of Dubno, in the Rivne Region. 7.  On 30 March 2000 criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant for failure to comply with a court decision ordering the reinstatement of a teacher at the private school. 8.  According to the applicant, at about 9.00 a.m. on 29 May 2000 officers from Dubno police broke down the front door of the applicant's house. Inside the house, an investigator from the Dubno inter-district prosecutor's office ordered the applicant to go to his office for questioning. When the applicant refused, the investigator asked the police officers to ensure her compulsory appearance for questioning. The police officers allegedly beat the applicant, twisted her arms behind her back and forced her out of the house barefoot. They placed her in a police car and took her to the office of the investigator. At about 1 p.m. on 29 May 2000 the applicant was released. 9.  On the next day, 30 May 2000, the applicant was examined by a doctor, who noted that there were injuries on her shoulders. 10.  On 9 April 2001 the Dubno inter-district prosecutor's office discontinued the investigation into the applicant's criminal case, having regard to the insignificance of her offence. 11.  On 2 August 2001 the Dubno Town Court quashed the decision of 9 April 2001 as unfounded and ordered that there be further investigation. 12.  On 14 August 2001 the investigation was completed and the case file was referred to the Dubno Town Court for trial. 13.  On 30 January 2004 and 13 March 2006 the Dubno Town Court issued judgments in the applicant's case, which were quashed as unfounded by the Rivne Regional Court of Appeal. 14.  On 30 January 2007 the Dubno Town Court convicted the applicant of failure to comply with a court decision, and decided that it was appropriate to punish her with a fine. However, ultimately it released the applicant from the punishment, as the statute of limitation had expired. 15.  On 17 April 2007 the Rivne Regional Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the judgment of 30 January 2007. 16.  On 13 November 2007 the Supreme Court refused to examine an appeal by the applicant on points of law, on the grounds that she had failed to comply with procedural rules when submitting it. 17.  On 2 June 2000 the applicant complained to the Rivne regional prosecutor's office regarding the events of 29 May 2000 (see paragraph 8 above). She was examined by a medical expert, who found that she had sustained five bruises to her shoulders and had injured her left shoulder ligaments. The expert stated that the injuries had been caused by blunt solid objects; they could have been sustained in the circumstances described by the applicant. 18.  On 30 June 2000 the Rivne regional prosecutor's office, having conducted a pre-investigation inquiry, refused to initiate criminal proceedings against the police officers because of the absence of the constituent elements of a criminal offence. 19.  On 20 March 2001, following a complaint by the applicant, the Prosecutor General's Office reversed the decision of 30 June 2000 as unsubstantiated, and ordered an additional inquiry. The applicant was not informed of the decision taken within the additional inquiry. In 2016 the Office of the Government Agent was informed that the file on those inquiries had been destroyed, along with other files relating to the same period, after the expiry of the statutory period for keeping such records. 20.  On 29 May 2003 the applicant lodged a civil claim with the Dubno Town Court, seeking damages for the violation of the inviolability of her home and her unlawful arrest and ill-treatment on 29 May 2000. 21.  On 9 July 2007 the Dubno Town Court found that on 29 May 2000 the applicant had been ill-treated and unlawfully taken from her home to the investigator's office. The court found that the authorities had acted unlawfully and that they had violated her right to the inviolability of her home, right to liberty and right to respect for human dignity. The court awarded the applicant 500 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH – approximately 73 euros (EUR) at the relevant time) in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. 22.  On 26 May 2008 the Lviv Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of 9 July 2007. 23.  The applicant appealed on points of law, contesting the amount of the award. 24.  On 8 May 2009 the Higher Administrative Court found that the appeal had not been prepared in a proper way. That court set a time-limit within which the applicant could rectify shortcomings in her appeal on points of law. 25.  On 13 July 2009 the Higher Administrative Court returned the applicant's appeal without examining it on the merits, after finding that she had failed to comply with the procedural requirements for submitting appeals.

Statute: Article 13 

Right to an effective remedy 

Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.
Fact pattern: 4.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 5.  The applicant was born in 1986 in the Georgian SSR of the USSR. In 1996, when he was ten years old, his parents divorced and he moved with his mother to Kaluga in Russia. In 2003, the applicant graduated from high school in Kaluga and began studies at the Finance and Economics Institute. 6.  On 4 May and 17 October 2005 the applicant was convicted of various offences and given a custodial sentence. Upon his release on 29 February 2008, he returned to Kaluga. 7.  On 12 January 2012 the police stopped the applicant in the courtyard of his house and charged him with illegal residence in Russia. 8.  On the following day the Kaluzhskiy District Court in the Kaluga Region found the applicant guilty of the administrative offence under Article 18.8 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences (failure to leave Russia upon the expiry of the authorised period of stay and illegal residence) and sentenced him to a fine of 2,500 Russian roubles (62 euros) and administrative removal from the Russian Federation. Pending removal, the District Court held that the applicant should be held in the detention centre. On 24 January 2012 the Kaluga Regional Court upheld the District Court's decision on appeal. 9.  The applicant asked the District Court to postpone the enforcement of the removal order, emphasising that it was currently unenforceable because he had no identity documents and because he was not a Georgian national and could not be sent to Georgia. On 12 April 2012 the District Court refused the applicant's request in a summary fashion. 10.  The applicant was held in the administrative detention centre operated by the Kaluga regional police. He shared Cell 13 measuring 8.7 square metres with five Uzbek nationals awaiting deportation. The cell had only one window, 90 centimetres by 120 centimetres, protected with three layers of thick netting and fitted with a matte glass. Two light bulbs, 40 Watts each, lit the cell. The cell was not ventilated. 11.  The toilet bowl sunk into the floor was located 40 centimetres from the nearest bed. It was cleaned with cold water without detergent. Prisoners were given three litres of water per day, it was not allowed to boil it. Once a week prisoners were taken to the shower room. There was not enough hot water for all of them and they took turns skipping the shower. 12.  There was no calendar or clock in the cell. Nor was there a radio, television, books or newspapers. Board games were forbidden. The applicant did not speak the Uzbek language and could not communicate with his cellmates. 13.  Prisoners were taken outdoors in groups of thirty. The yard was small, six by four metres, so they huddled together. It had no sports equipment or awning for bad weather. 14.  The applicant's complaints to a prosecutor were rejected as unfounded. In January and March 2012 two members of the Kaluga public monitoring commission visited the facility. Their report corroborated the applicant's description of his conditions of detention. 15.  In May 2012 the applicant developed pulmonary tuberculosis. He was transferred for treatment to a civilian hospital in Kaluga.

The statute clearly states that everyone whose rights and freedoms are violated is entitled to an effective remedy before a national authority, regardless of the violation being committed by persons acting in an official capacity. In the fact pattern provided, it is evident that the applicant's rights were violated through various actions by the authorities, such as the illegal residence charge and the conditions of detention.

Protection of property 

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. 

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicants were born in 1968, 1960, 1966, 1962, 1959, 1955 and 1954, respectively, and live in Novi Travnik and Bugojno, Bosnia and Herzegovina. 6.  By seven judgments of the Travnik Municipal Court and the Bugojno Municipal Court, of 19 January 2007, 15 May 2008, 19 January 2006, 28 October 2011, 2 February 2009, 1 September 2009 and 9 April 2004, respectively, the applicants' employers, two companies manufacturing weapons and military technology, were ordered to pay them various sums in respect of unpaid work-related benefits together with default interest at the statutory rate and legal costs. The judgments became final on 24 August 2007, 15 May 2008, 19 January 2006, 26 November 2011, 20 August 2009, 13 October 2009 and 13 April 2005, respectively. 7.  The applicants' winding-up petitions were rejected on 27 May 2010 and 14 February 2011, respectively, because the Federal Ministry of Energy had refused authorisation (see paragraph 14 below). Consequently, in accordance with the 2003 Insolvency Act, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina became liable for the debts of the applicants' employers (see paragraph 14 below). 8.  The Sarajevo Municipal Court issued enforcement orders on 9 November 2011, 21 February 2012, 17 April 2012, 25 April 2012, 5 July 2012, 27 March 2012 and 9 August 2012, respectively, in which the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was designated as a debtor. They were transferred to the competent bank and were listed among the charges in the federal budget. 9.  On several occasions thereafter the bank informed the competent courts that the enforcement was not possible because the budgetary funds intended for that purpose had already been spent. 10.  The applicants complained of the non-enforcement to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (""the Constitutional Court""). 11.  On 17 March 2015 (decision no. AP 2892/13) the Constitutional Court found a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in the applicants' cases on account of the prolonged non-enforcement of the final judgments in their favour. It ordered the government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take the necessary steps in order to secure the payment of its debt arising from the final judgments within a reasonable time. Although the applicants submitted a claim for non-pecuniary damages, the Constitutional Court did not award any compensation. 12.  On the following dates in 2017 the final judgments in the applicants' favour were fully enforced:
(i) on 10 January 2017 in respect of Mr Mujo Zahirović;

There is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern. While the fact pattern describes the applicant being detained for illegal residence in Russia, it does not provide details on whether the detention was carried out in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law as outlined in Article 5 of the statute. The fact pattern raises concerns about the conditions of detention, the lack of communication with cellmates, inadequate access to water and hygiene facilities, as well as the development of pulmonary tuberculosis. These conditions could potentially violate the right to liberty and security as outlined in the statute.

Right to an effective remedy 

Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1975 and is detained in the Corradino Correctional Facility, Paola, Malta. 6.  The applicant is currently serving a term of imprisonment for drug-related offences. On 3 December 2009 he was sentenced to sixteen years' imprisonment and fined 40,000 euros (EUR) by the Criminal Court. The punishment was confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 19 September 2013. 7.  The applicant started to serve his prison sentence and on 10 December 2009 he had been placed in Division 2 (cell no. 88) of the Corradino Correctional Facility. He remained in various cells in Division 2 to date, except for two brief periods in 2011 where he had been placed in Division 6 (a high security unit) for nine and eleven days respectively, the latter ending on 4 December 2011. In particular after 4 December 2011 the applicant had been staying in cell no. 45 until 26 December 2014 and thereafter had been hosted in cell no. 70, both in Division 2. 8.  The applicant alleged that a huge amount of maintenance was needed to the area due to its old age (around 200 years old) and that it lacked both light and air. Windows were behind two iron grids and a third layer of exterior iron bars (hereinafter referred to as ‘triple‑barred windows'). Division 2 also had three skylights, which were kept closed even during the summer months, leading to a great amount of heat. The ""environment"" was squalid and had a bad smell. 9.  In the period during which he had been placed in cell no. 45, the applicant had had to suffer the fumes and excessive heat from the bakery close to his cell, which fumes and heat poured into his poorly ventilated cell. The applicant also described the cell as being nearly underground and as structurally condemned. Due the triple-barred windows he could barely see outside. In winter the cell was very humid and cold. 10.  When, on 26 December 2014, he moved to cell no. 70 (see paragraph 7 above), which was very small and had very little ventilation; the applicant felt claustrophobic. Furthermore, he claimed to hardly ever having had access to running water. 11.  According to the applicant, in Division 2 the food was of a very poor quality, non-nutritious, and portions were too small. Additionally, the food quality was so terrible that between 1 and 4 September 2015 prisoners had to be taken to hospital as a result of food poisoning. The applicant claimed that the kitchen was so dirty that mice were found dead in it. 12.  The applicant complained that there was no combined automated toilet‑flushing system installed. Therefore, inmates had to flush their own personal toilet by means of a water bucket which was provided to them. Moreover, at times there was no access to running water in the cell. Access to water was limited in general, and water available was not potable. While inmates were permitted to buy bottled water, they were forced to reduce their daily intake when they were short on cash. 13.  As to the showers, hot water was often not available and the water was dirty. The applicant submitted that there were not enough showers, with one of the showers having a broken and cracked tray that could cause injury if one were not careful. He alleged that, for all the inmates in Division 2, only one shower was available most of the time, with two showers being available during the summer months. 14.  The applicant claimed that the cost to make telephone calls was very high and had been increased on 3 December 2014. He had complained to the prison authorities to no avail. 15.  He complained that the prison allowance given to detainees was too little. This made everything available at the tuck shop excessively expensive. It inevitably also impacted the inmates' ability to buy bottled water and make telephone calls. 16.  The applicant claimed to have suffered health issues and had even been confined to his bed because of illness for some time. The emergency buzzer in the cell never worked and when he had been confined to his bed because of illness and tried to ring it, no one came, since the buzzer did not work. It took thirty minutes for someone from the staff to show up, at which point he was told off by the staff member. 17.  Petitions were filed in regard to these conditions. Furthermore, some of his fellow inmates had lodged constitutional cases concerning the situation. However, none led to any change. The applicant's rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention were violated.

Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;

(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Kyiv. 6.  At the time of the events he was the director of a private company. 7.  In August 2002 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of tax evasion and forgery in office. Subsequently, the tax-evasion charge was dropped. 8.  On 7 December 2004 the Kyiv Dniprovskyy District Court (""the Dniprovskyy Court"") found the applicant guilty of forgery in office. It held that he had entered knowingly false data in the company's tax returns. More specifically, instead of applying a straight-line depreciation method in respect of the company's intangible assets, the applicant calculated their depreciation costs as the difference between the company's gross revenues and expenses. As a result, the documents showed the absence of any profit or loss in the company's activity, whereas in the reality it had had losses. The applicant was sentenced to one year's restriction of liberty (namely detention in a semi-open penal institution by the place of his residence) with a ban on holding administrative posts for one year. The sentence was suspended on probation for one year. The applicant was under an undertaking not to leave the town until the judgment became final. 9.  The applicant appealed. He submitted that the activity of the company had been subject to numerous tax inspections, which had not found any violations of the tax legislation. He therefore contended that he had not done anything criminal and that that fact had not received due attention of the first-instance court. Furthermore, the applicant considered that the expert questioned in the trial did not have adequate qualification. Lastly, he argued that the tax police investigator, who had also been questioned, was not impartial and that his statements should not have been relied on. Accordingly, the applicant requested the appellate court to quash the first‑instance court's judgment and to pronounce a new one, acquitting him for the lack of the constituent elements of a crime in his actions. 10.  On 10 February 2005 the Dniprovskyy Court sent a letter to the Kyiv City Court of Appeal (""the Court of Appeal"") stating as follows:
""The [Dniprovskyy Court] is sending you the criminal case regarding [the applicant] convicted under Article 366 § 1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine [forgery in office], for the appellate examination at 10.35 a.m. on 17 March 2005."" 11.  In addition to the president of the Court of Appeal, the above letter was also addressed to the prosecutor, the applicant and his lawyer. There is no evidence in the case file as to whether the applicant and/or his lawyer received it. According to the applicant, they were unaware of its existence. 12.  On 17 March 2005, following a hearing held with the prosecutor's participation, but in the absence of both the applicant and his lawyer, the appellate court rejected the applicant's appeal. It delivered its ruling ""having heard the report of the judge-rapporteur of the appellate court and the explanations of the prosecutor, the latter considering the judgment lawful and [the applicant's] appeal groundless, having checked the case-file materials and having discussed the arguments advanced in the appeal"". The issue of the applicant's and his lawyer's absence from the hearing was not mentioned in the appellate court's ruling. 13.  The applicant appealed on points of law, challenging, among other things, the examination of his case on appeal in his and his lawyer's absence as being in breach of his defence rights. 14.  On 23 January 2007 the Supreme Court, in written proceedings, upheld the decisions of the lower courts. Referring to the case-file materials, it noted that the first-instance court had informed the applicant and his lawyer about the scheduled appellate hearing, without further details.

(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.","5.  The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Kyiv. 6.  At the time of the events he was the director of a private company. 7.  In August 2002 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of tax evasion and forgery in office. Subsequently, the tax-evasion charge was dropped. 8.  On 7 December 2004 the Kyiv Dniprovskyy District Court (""the Dniprovskyy Court"") found the applicant guilty of forgery in office. It held that he had entered knowingly false data in the company's tax returns. More specifically, instead of applying a straight-line depreciation method in respect of the company's intangible assets, the applicant calculated their depreciation costs as the difference between the company's gross revenues and expenses. As a result, the documents showed the absence of any profit or loss in the company's activity, whereas in the reality it had had losses. The applicant was sentenced to one year's restriction of liberty (namely detention in a semi-open penal institution by the place of his residence) with a ban on holding administrative posts for one year. The sentence was suspended on probation for one year. The applicant was under an undertaking not to leave the town until the judgment became final. 9.  The applicant appealed. He submitted that the activity of the company had been subject to numerous tax inspections, which had not found any violations of the tax legislation. He therefore contended that he had not done anything criminal and that that fact had not received due attention of the first-instance court. Furthermore, the applicant considered that the expert questioned in the trial did not have adequate qualification. Lastly, he argued that the tax police investigator, who had also been questioned, was not impartial and that his statements should not have been relied on. Accordingly, the applicant requested the appellate court to quash the first‑instance court's judgment and to pronounce a new one, acquitting him for the lack of the constituent elements of a crime in his actions. 10.  On 10 February 2005 the Dniprovskyy Court sent a letter to the Kyiv City Court of Appeal (""the Court of Appeal"") stating as follows:
""The [Dniprovskyy Court] is sending you the criminal case regarding [the applicant] convicted under Article 366 § 1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine [forgery in office], for the appellate examination at 10.35 a.m. on 17 March 2005."" 11.  In addition to the president of the Court of Appeal, the above letter was also addressed to the prosecutor, the applicant and his lawyer. There is no evidence in the case file as to whether the applicant and/or his lawyer received it. According to the applicant, they were unaware of its existence. 12.  On 17 March 2005, following a hearing held with the prosecutor's participation, but in the absence of both the applicant and his lawyer, the appellate court rejected the applicant's appeal. It delivered its ruling ""having heard the report of the judge-rapporteur of the appellate court and the explanations of the prosecutor, the latter considering the judgment lawful and [the applicant's] appeal groundless, having checked the case-file materials and having discussed the arguments advanced in the appeal"". The issue of the applicant's and his lawyer's absence from the hearing was not mentioned in the appellate court's ruling. 13.  The applicant appealed on points of law, challenging, among other things, the examination of his case on appeal in his and his lawyer's absence as being in breach of his defence rights. 14.  On 23 January 2007 the Supreme Court, in written proceedings, upheld the decisions of the lower courts. Referring to the case-file materials, it noted that the first-instance court had informed the applicant and his lawyer about the scheduled appellate hearing, without further details.","True

Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; 
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Smolyan. 5.  In two final judgments of 28 February 2005 and 8 May 2006 the Supreme Court of Cassation awarded the applicant pecuniary damages in respect of breach of contract for construction works which she had carried out. The awarded damages comprised BGN 52,784 for the principal amount, plus BGN 17,685 in default interest and BGN 5,433 in costs and expenses, or a total amount of BGN 75,902.93, the equivalent to 38,000 euros (EUR). The damages were awarded to the applicant against the National Centre for Recreation, Rehabilitation and Sport – Ministry of Education and Science (""the Centre"", a State body subsidised by the Ministry of Education and Science and exercising certain functions delegated by the Ministry). 6.  By an order of 25 May 2005 the Minister of Education closed down the Centre and ordered that its remaining property be managed by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry then established a State-owned joint‑stock company with part of the Centre's property, including the real estate in which the applicant had carried out the construction works. 7.  On 13 May 2005 and 15 March 2007 the applicant was issued with two writs of enforcement for the amounts awarded in the final judgments of 2005 and 2006 (see paragraph 5 above) and on 6 February 2008 she presented the writs to the Ministry of Education asking it to pay. 8.  The Ministry replied in writing that it was not the successor to the Centre and did not owe payment to the applicant. In October 2009 the applicant reiterated her request but received a similar reply by the Ministry. The Ministry also pointed out that payment could not be sought from the State-owned joint-stock company either as it had a legal personality separate from that of the Ministry. By a letter of 23 September 2010, the Minister provided a similar explanation to the applicant. 9.  The applicant brought judicial review proceedings challenging the Minister's refusal. In a final decision of 8 April 2011 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the appeal as inadmissible. 10.  As of 19 March 2015, the date of the applicant's last communication to the Court, no change in the above circumstances had been reported.

Prohibition of torture

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Batumi. 5.  On 2 September 2008 at 10.05 a.m. the applicant was arrested (together with his friend Z.B.) in Batumi on suspicion of possession of illegal drugs, by members of the Special Operations Unit (სოდის სამმართველო) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (""the MIA""). According to the report of his detention and personal search, he physically resisted the arrest. As a result he sustained injuries to his face and both legs when being forced out of his car and on to the ground. The applicant signed this report without making any written comments. 6.  At 5:35 p.m. on the same day the applicant underwent an external visual examination at the Batumi no. 1 temporary detention centre. A report drawn up thereafter recorded multiple injuries on the applicant's body, including bruises and abrasions on his face and head, both legs, and the waist area, and black and swollen eyes. A note was made to the effect that the applicant could not remember in what circumstances he had sustained those injuries and that he had no complaints about the arresting officers. 7.  Soon afterwards an ambulance was called for the applicant. He was pre-diagnosed as suffering from possible concussion and was recommended for a transfer to a medical establishment. An hour later an ambulance was called again. After the applicant had been examined, he was diagnosed with a closed head injury and concussion; bruises were noted on his chest and waist area and it was recommended that he undergo inpatient treatment in a hospital neurosurgery department. 8.  At 10.10 p.m. the applicant was taken to Batumi hospital. After a brain tomography examination and other medical check-ups the diagnosis of a head injury was not confirmed. He was diagnosed instead with a fracture of the maxillary sinus on the right side, multiple bruises, and excoriations on his face and body. He was then taken back to the temporary detention centre. 9.  On the same night the applicant's lawyer called the hotline of the office of the Prosecutor General of Georgia, complaining that the applicant had been ill-treated. On 4 September 2008 criminal proceedings were initiated under Article 118 § 2 of the Criminal Code of Georgia (causing less serious bodily injury). On the same date the investigator dealing with the case ordered a forensic examination of the applicant. Having visually examined the applicant, the medical expert concluded on 10 September 2008 that the applicant had multiple scratches and bruises all over his body and face, as well as black eyes and a fracture of the right maxillary sinus. He noted that the injuries could have been sustained on 2 September 2008 by the impact of a hard blunt object, and cumulatively belonged to the category of less serious bodily injuries causing long-lasting damage to health. 10.  On 4 September 2008 the applicant was questioned in connection with the circumstances of his arrest. He maintained his allegations of ill treatment, claiming that he had been beaten during the arrest as well as after he was transferred to the Special Operations Unit at the MIA. He further dismissed the accusation that he had resisted arrest as untrue. On 6 September 2008 the investigator questioned two employees of the Batumi no. 1 temporary detention centre. They both confirmed that the applicant had had multiple injuries when he had arrived at the detention centre, and that in reply to their question he had claimed that he had sustained those injuries during the arrest. He had not provided any additional details, and had not made any complaints against the arresting police officers. 11.  On 17 November 2008 the investigator decided to continue the investigation under Article 333 § 1 of the Criminal Code of Georgia (abuse of power). In the meantime, on 15 November 2008, the applicant's lawyer lodged a complaint with the General Prosecutor's Office denouncing the investigation as ineffective. He complained about the fact that no identification parade had been carried out: this would have allowed the applicant to identify the police officers who had ill-treated him during the arrest. Nor was this done in respect of the time after he was transferred to the Special Operations Unit, where he had stayed for about seven hours. He also noted that he had requested footage from the video surveillance cameras in the street where the arrest operation had taken place, but that his request had received no response. By a letter of 15 January 2009 the prosecutor dealing with the case informed the applicant's lawyer that the investigation was still pending, and that in view of the conflicting evidence it was impossible to establish whether the force used against the applicant during the arrest had been proportionate or not. The applicant's lawyer was also informed that the surveillance cameras in question had not been working on the day of the applicant's arrest, so no video recording could have been obtained. 12.  According to the Government, at the time they submitted their observations the investigation of the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment was still pending. 13.  According to the bill of indictment, the applicant was charged with various drug offences under Article 260 § 3 (a) and Article 273 of the Criminal Code. On 18 March 2009 the Batumi City Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to fourteen years and three months' imprisonment and a fine. His conviction was confirmed by the Kutaisi Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Georgia on 23 September and 18 November 2009 respectively.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Belebey, Republic of Bashkortostan. 5.  In October 2007 the applicant and his family moved from Uzbekistan to Russia, apparently for the purpose of obtaining Russian nationality as well as seeking medical treatment for the applicant's drug addiction. 6.  In December 2007 the Uzbek authorities charged the applicant with large-scale drug-trafficking committed in October 2007 and issued a detention order and an international search warrant. 7.  On 12 July 2008 the applicant was arrested in Moscow and on 14 July 2008 the Dragomilovskiy District Court of Moscow ordered the applicant's detention pending extradition, without setting any time-limit. 8.  On 9 December 2008 the Russian Prosecutor General's Office ordered the applicant's extradition. 9.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Klaipėda. 5.  On 2 July 2013 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with intention to distribute. On 9 July 2013 the applicant was brought to Šiauliai Remand Prison and was held there until 31 May 2016. In judgment of 23 December 2015 the applicant was sentenced to four years imprisonment by the Klaipėda District Court. Following an appeal by the applicant, the judgment became final on 25 May 2016. The applicant was then transferred to Alytus Correctional Facility and after serving his sentence was released on 30 June 2017. 6.  In April 2014 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Šiauliai Regional Administrative Court about his conditions of detention in Šiauliai Remand Prison. He complained of: overcrowding; of there being no partition wall between toilets and cells; of insufficient ventilation; of insufficient time in the open air; of insufficient time for showering; of the presence of cockroaches; of inmates smoking in the cells; of no long-stay or short visits; of the fact that he had not been allowed to go home; of the low energy value of the food provided; of the prohibition on receiving food from relatives and friends; and of the prohibition on having his own blanket and a music player. 7.  On 27 June 2014 the Šiauliai Regional Administrative Court held that for 135 days the applicant had been housed in cell no. 53, and the personal space available to him had varied between 1.87 and 3.12 sq. m. This had been a clear violation of domestic norms. For eighty-seven days the applicant had been held in cell no. 50, where the personal space available to him had varied between 1.86 and 4.65 sq. m, and it had come close to a violation of domestic norms. The court further held that the presence of toilets in the applicant's cell had not corresponded to the requirements of domestic law, that the lighting had been insufficient and the temperature had been too low, and that the food provided had had insufficient energy value. The court noted that inmates could buy food and other necessities in the shops of the facility. The applicant's other complaints were dismissed as unsubstantiated. As regards the prohibition on having his own blanket and a music player, the court held that the use of personal blankets was not allowed in accordance with domestic norms. As for music players, inmates could use television sets, computers, computer-game devices, discs that could not be rewritten, other memory cards of up to 4GB and bedding (except for a pillow, a mattress and a blanket) that could be given to them by their spouses, partners or close relatives. As regards long-stay and short visits, the court held that remand prisoners did not have a right to long-stay visits but he had a right to short visits of up to two hours. The applicant asked for a long-stay visit but on 20 January 2014 the prosecutor decided not to allow him such a visit. The court also held that inmates could be allowed to go home for up to five days in the event of the death or serious illness of a spouse, partner or close relative, or in the event of a natural disaster that had caused serious pecuniary damage to the inmate, his or her spouse, partner or close relatives. However, in his request of 31 January 2014 the applicant did not indicate any of those circumstances. As a result, the applicant was awarded 1,200 Lithuanian litai (LTL – approximately 348 euros (EUR)) in compensation for inadequate material conditions of detention for 222 days during the period between 9 July 2013 and 3 April 2014. 8.  The applicant appealed, and on 11 February 2015 the Supreme Administrative Court held that it was impossible to calculate for how many days the applicant had had sufficient personal space at his disposal, and decided to hold that for 245 days the applicant had not had sufficient personal space, and that this had been a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The court thus decided to increase the compensation to EUR 1,500. 9.  In October 2014 the applicant lodged a new complaint concerning his material conditions in Šiauliai Remand Prison. He complained of overcrowding, low temperature, dampness, insufficient lighting, prisoners smoking in the cells, that his partner had not been able to pay him a long‑stay visit and that he had not been allowed to ""take holidays"". It appears that the applicant had asked the prison management to allow him to receive a long-stay visit from his spouse and his sister on 28 April 2014. 10.  On 5 December 2014 the Šiauliai Regional Administrative Court held that during the period between 4 April and 5 October 2014 – for 176 days – the applicant had had insufficient cell space. As regards long-stay visits, the court agreed with Šiauliai Remand Prison and stated that the applicant had not been entitled to them under domestic law; he could have had short visits but, however, he had never asked for them. The court accepted the argument of the Šiauliai Remand Prison that remand detainees had been held in prisons or correctional facilities for short periods of time and they were not in a similar situation to convicted inmates. The court awarded the applicant EUR 869 in compensation for the material conditions of his detention. 11.  The applicant appealed, and on 21 September 2015 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the first-instance decision in its entirety.

Right to an effective remedy

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1975 and is detained in the Corradino Correctional Facility, Paola, Malta. 6.  The applicant is currently serving a term of imprisonment for drug-related offences. On 3 December 2009 he was sentenced to sixteen years' imprisonment and fined 40,000 euros (EUR) by the Criminal Court. The punishment was confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 19 September 2013. 7.  The applicant started to serve his prison sentence and on 10 December 2009 he had been placed in Division 2 (cell no. 88) of the Corradino Correctional Facility. He remained in various cells in Division 2 to date, except for two brief periods in 2011 where he had been placed in Division 6 (a high security unit) for nine and eleven days respectively, the latter ending on 4 December 2011. In particular after 4 December 2011 the applicant had been staying in cell no. 45 until 26 December 2014 and thereafter had been hosted in cell no. 70, both in Division 2. 8.  The applicant alleged that a huge amount of maintenance was needed to the area due to its old age (around 200 years old) and that it lacked both light and air. Windows were behind two iron grids and a third layer of exterior iron bars (hereinafter referred to as ‘triple‑barred windows'). Division 2 also had three skylights, which were kept closed even during the summer months, leading to a great amount of heat. The ""environment"" was squalid and had a bad smell. 9.  In the period during which he had been placed in cell no. 45, the applicant had had to suffer the fumes and excessive heat from the bakery close to his cell, which fumes and heat poured into his poorly ventilated cell. The applicant also described the cell as being nearly underground and as structurally condemned. Due the triple-barred windows he could barely see outside. In winter the cell was very humid and cold. 10.  When, on 26 December 2014, he moved to cell no. 70 (see paragraph 7 above), which was very small and had very little ventilation; the applicant felt claustrophobic. Furthermore, he claimed to hardly ever having had access to running water. 11.  According to the applicant, in Division 2 the food was of a very poor quality, non-nutritious, and portions were too small. Additionally, the food quality was so terrible that between 1 and 4 September 2015 prisoners had to be taken to hospital as a result of food poisoning. The applicant claimed that the kitchen was so dirty that mice were found dead in it. 12.  The applicant complained that there was no combined automated toilet‑flushing system installed. Therefore, inmates had to flush their own personal toilet by means of a water bucket which was provided to them. Moreover, at times there was no access to running water in the cell. Access to water was limited in general, and water available was not potable. While inmates were permitted to buy bottled water, they were forced to reduce their daily intake when they were short on cash. 13.  As to the showers, hot water was often not available and the water was dirty. The applicant submitted that there were not enough showers, with one of the showers having a broken and cracked tray that could cause injury if one were not careful. He alleged that, for all the inmates in Division 2, only one shower was available most of the time, with two showers being available during the summer months. 14.  The applicant claimed that the cost to make telephone calls was very high and had been increased on 3 December 2014. He had complained to the prison authorities to no avail. 15.  He complained that the prison allowance given to detainees was too little. This made everything available at the tuck shop excessively expensive. It inevitably also impacted the inmates' ability to buy bottled water and make telephone calls. 16.  The applicant claimed to have suffered health issues and had even been confined to his bed because of illness for some time. The emergency buzzer in the cell never worked and when he had been confined to his bed because of illness and tried to ring it, no one came, since the buzzer did not work. It took thirty minutes for someone from the staff to show up, at which point he was told off by the staff member. 17.  Petitions were filed in regard to these conditions. Furthermore, some of his fellow inmates had lodged constitutional cases concerning the situation. However, none led to any change. The applicant's rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention were violated.

Explanation: There is no legal ambiguity in the application of Article 13 to the fact pattern provided.

The statute clearly states that everyone whose rights and freedoms are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority, regardless of the violation being committed by persons acting in an official capacity.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Belebey, Republic of Bashkortostan. 5.  In October 2007 the applicant and his family moved from Uzbekistan to Russia, apparently for the purpose of obtaining Russian nationality as well as seeking medical treatment for the applicant's drug addiction. 6.  In December 2007 the Uzbek authorities charged the applicant with large-scale drug-trafficking committed in October 2007 and issued a detention order and an international search warrant. 7.  On 12 July 2008 the applicant was arrested in Moscow and on 14 July 2008 the Dragomilovskiy District Court of Moscow ordered the applicant's detention pending extradition, without setting any time-limit. 8.  On 9 December 2008 the Russian Prosecutor General's Office ordered the applicant's extradition. 9.  On 28 January 2009 the Moscow City Court confirmed the lawfulness of the applicant's arrest and detention, and upheld the extradition. 10.  In the meantime, on 4 March 2009 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the judgment of 28 January 2009. 11.

However, after the Russian Government had informed the Court about the extradition on 21 August 2009, the interim measure was lifted on 7 October 2009. 15.  The parties submitted no information on related events in Uzbekistan. 16.  On an unspecified date the applicant joined his family in Russia.

Freedom of expression 

1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. 

2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Chișinău. 6.  The applicant has been involved in numerous protests against alleged acts of corruption and abuse committed by police officers, prosecutors and judges. He was himself the victim of police abuse, ill-treatment and prosecutorial inaction (see Mătăsaru and Saviţchi v. Moldova, no. 38281/08, 2 November 2010). Each year during the professional holiday of the prosecutors or the police he stages protests involving live animals, toilets, caricatures and masks. 7.  On 29 January 2013, the professional holiday of prosecutors in Moldova, the applicant conducted a one person demonstration in front of the Prosecutor General's Office. According to him, the aim of the protest was to draw public attention to the corruption and the control exercised by politicians over the Prosecutor General's Office. At 10 a.m. he started his protest by installing two large wooden sculptures on the stairs of the Prosecutor General's Office. The first sculpture represented an erect penis with a picture of the face of a high-ranking politician attached to its head. The sculpture had a white collar and a tie and measured two metres. The second sculpture represented a large vulva with pictures of several high‑ranking prosecutors between the labia. The applicant also inflated balloons in the form of male genitals and attached them to the nearby trees. 8.  The demonstration was observed from the beginning by several police officers and numerous journalists approached to interview the applicant. At 11 a.m. a police van approached, the sculptures were removed by police officers and the applicant was taken to a police station. 9.  Later the applicant was charged with the criminal offence of hooliganism. The criminal investigation was conducted by a department of the Prosecutor General's Office whose head's picture had been attached to the sculpture of the vulva. 10.  On 2 March 2015 the Râșcani District Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. The sentence was suspended for a period of three years. In deciding on the sanction to be applied, the court took into consideration the fact that the applicant had previously been sanctioned with fines for similar deeds and that those sanctions had proved to be inefficient. The court considered that the applicant's deeds had been immoral because he had exposed obscene sculptures in a public place where they could be seen by anyone, including by children. The court based its findings on the statements of several prosecution witnesses who had stated that they had disliked the sculptures exposed by the applicant and had considered them to be indecent and obscene. The court also stated that assimilating public officials with genitals went beyond the acceptable limits of criticism in a democratic society and was therefore not an act protected under Article 10 of the Convention. Moreover, the accusations meant to be made by the applicant by means of his protest against the officials concerned lacked a factual basis and had been contrary to the principle of presumption of innocence. 11.  The applicant appealed against the above decision arguing, inter alia, that it ran contrary to his rights guaranteed by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. 12.  On 2 November 2015 the Chișinău Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. 13.  The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court of Justice in which he reiterated his position that his conviction had been contrary to the provisions of the Convention and stated that the sculptures had represented a form of artistic expression which was to be protected under Article 10 of the Convention. He reiterated that his protest had been against the corruption within the Prosecutor General's Office and among high-ranking politicians, a phenomenon which was universally known and did not need to be proved. He also argued that the sculptures exposed by him could not be considered obscene. In any event, at the time of his protest, children were normally at schools and kindergartens. The fact that some of the prosecution witnesses disliked what they saw was not sufficient to hold him responsible for a criminal offence. The applicant admitted that the form of the protest chosen by him had been striking, however he considered this manner of protesting as the only way possible to make himself heard in a society which was oversaturated with subjects of discussion. The applicant finally submitted that the sanction applied to him had been disproportionately harsh and that it had had a chilling effect on him. He pointed to the fact that the first-instance court had admitted to having pursued the goal of discouraging his future involvement in protests. By the application of a suspended sentence, he had in fact been forced to abstain from organising further protests for a period of three years or risk being imprisoned. 14.  On 20 April 2016 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the applicant's appeal on points of law and upheld the judgments of the lower courts. The decision was notified to the applicant on 19 May 2016.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicants were born in 1982 and 1981 respectively. 5.  On 22 April 2006 upon receipt of intelligence reports that the youth branch of the PKK would be holding a meeting in the premises of a cooperative, the police officers, under the orders of the magistrates' court, conducted a search in the premises of the co-operative of which the applicants were members. The police seized several documents and CDs that contained propaganda materials related to the youth branch of the PKK. 6.  On the same day the applicants were taken into custody on suspicion of being members of a terrorist organisation. 7.  On 24 April 2006 the Urfa Magistrates' Court ordered the applicants' detention on remand. 8.  On 27 April 2006 and 28 April 2006, respectively, the applicants filed objections against their pre-trial detention. The courts rejected their request on the basis of the case-file, without holding a hearing. 9.  During the pre-trial stage, the magistrates' court continued to examine, by virtue of Article 108 of Law no. 5271, the necessity of applicants' continued detention every thirty days on the basis of the case file, without holding an oral hearing. The applicants also filed objections against their continued pre-trial detention, namely on 15 June, 12 July, 17 July, 1 August and 17 October 2006.

Statute: Article 6 

Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; 
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1979. He is currently serving a prison sentence. 6.  On 17 April 1999 the Fier District Court (""the District Court""), following proceedings in which the applicant did not take part, convicted the applicant and his two co-accused of a number of serious criminal offences. It sentenced the applicant to death in absentia. 7.  On 1 June 1999 the Vlora Court of Appeal (""the Court of Appeal""), following appeals lodged by the two other co-accused, upheld the District Court's decision of 17 April 1999. 8.  On 8 May 2001, following appeals lodged by the applicant's co‑accused, the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions. However, it sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment. 9.  On 1 December 2006 the applicant was extradited to Albania from Italy. He was officially informed of his conviction in absentia on the same day. 10.  On 8 December 2006 the applicant lodged an application with the District Court for leave to appeal out of time. 11.  On 25 January 2007 the District Court dismissed the application, finding that the Supreme Court's decision of 8 May 2001 had become res judicata and that, consequently, the applicant could not be tried a second time for the same offence. 12.  On 8 June 2007 and 2 July 2010, following the applicant's appeals, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, respectively, upheld that decision. 13.  On 8 June 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the Supreme Court's decision of 2 July 2010. He also complained about the unfairness of the proceedings in absentia. 14.  On 21 September 2011, the Constitutional Court, sitting as a full bench, rejected the appeal by a majority. It found that the applicant's complaint against the Supreme Court's decision of 2 July 2010 was manifestly ill-founded. As regards his complaint about the unfairness of the proceedings in absentia, and the domestic courts' dismissal of his application for leave to appeal out of time, the Constitutional Court noted that the applicant had not complained about the domestic courts' decisions taken in absentia (see paragraphs 6-8 above). It further found that that complaint was in any event time-barred. It also reasoned that in the present case the Supreme Court's unifying decision no. 1 of 20 January 2011 was applicable (see Izet Haxhia v. Albania, no. 34783/06, §§ 28-31, 5 November 2013). In addition, it noted that although the appeals before the Supreme Court against the lower courts' decision were lodged by the co‑accused and not the applicant, the Supreme Court had examined and amended the lower courts' decisions of 17 April and 1 June 1999 also in respect of the applicant. 15.  On an unspecified date in 2007 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the District Court's decision of 17 April 1999, the Court of Appeal's decision of 1 June 1999 and the Supreme Court's decision of 8 May 2001 complaining about his conviction in absentia. 16.  On 21 September 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal as having been lodged out of time, considering that the two-year time-limit had started to run as from 8 May 2001. The decision was communicated to the applicant's lawyer on 25 September 2007.

In this fact pattern, there is no legal ambiguity in the application of Article 6 to the situation described. The applicant was convicted in absentia for serious criminal offences, sentenced to life imprisonment, informed of the conviction upon extradition to Albania, and subsequently attempted to appeal the decision through various courts including the Constitutional Court. The process followed the established legal procedures in Albania, even though the applicant raised concerns about the unfairness of the proceedings and the dismissal of his application for leave to appeal out of time. The courts' decisions were based on the law and previous judgments, and there is no indication of a violation of his right to a fair trial as outlined in Article 6 of the statute.",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,1,"While it depends on the definition of ""fair and public trial,"" it appears that the applicant not appearing at the proceedings threatens this right.",FALSE,N/A,incorrect concl,FALSE
