Explanation: The legal ambiguity arises from the need to determine if the time period Alice was alive and contributing towards the home, combined with the period after her passing where Bob solely provided for the household, cumulatively meets the requirement of the household being the principal place of abode for more than half of the taxable year for Charlie. The calculation of the time period during which the home was maintained as the principal place of abode for Charlie involves considerations of both Alice's and Bob's contributions and the definition of ""taxable year"" in the context of the household's maintenance following Alice's death.
