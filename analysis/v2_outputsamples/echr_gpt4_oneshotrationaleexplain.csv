Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; 
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant company, Virprod-Lux S.R.L., is a company incorporated in Moldova. 6.  On 13 April 2000 the Tax Authority seized a building from a State‑owned company, company V., on account of taxes which were due. 7.  On 1 October 2000, at the request of the Tax Authority, the building was valued by an estate agency at 352,000 Moldovan lei (MDL). 8.  On 29 January 2001 the Department of Privatisation and Administration of State Property sold the building in question to company B. for MDL 360,500 (approximately 29,678 Euros (EUR), following a public auction. 9.  On 25 April 2003 the applicant company bought the building from company B. for MDL 628,000 (approximately EUR 22,053). 10.  On 29 March 2007 the Prosecutor General's Office initiated court proceedings in which it sought the annulment of both the sale of the building on 29 January 2001 and the subsequent transaction between company B. and the applicant company. It also sought the return of the building to its initial owner, company V. The reason relied upon by the Prosecutor's General's Office was that the valuation of the building conducted by the estate agency had not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of the law. The applicant company opposed the Prosecutor General's action and argued, among other things, that it was time-barred. 11.  On 21 August 2007 the Economic Court of Appeal dismissed the Prosecutor General's action as time-barred. The court held, inter alia, that in accordance with the statute of limitations, the Prosecutor General's action could not be initiated more than three years after the events in dispute had taken place. 12.  On 11 October 2007 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld an appeal by the Prosecutor General, reversed the judgment of the Economic Court of Appeal, and upheld the action in its entirety. The Supreme Court considered that the Prosecutor General's action concerned a declaration of the absolute nullity of the contracts in question and that therefore, in accordance with Article 217 of the Civil Code, enacted on 12 June 2003, it could not be limited in time. Following this judgment, the transactions of 29 January 2001 and 25 April 2003 were annulled and each party involved was ordered to return to the other parties whatever they received by virtue of those transactions. 13.  On 7 December 2007 the applicant company lodged a revision request against the above judgment in which it indicated that it had carried out an expert evaluation of the disputed building by an independent expert who determined its value at MDL 8,550,000 (approximately EUR 511,440) after the improvements made by the applicant company to it. 14.  In the meantime, the applicant company did not leave the disputed building because it had its production line there and it needed time and resources to find another suitable building and to move its production line. 15.  Since company V. did not need the disputed building, the applicant company proposed to it and the latter accepted to conclude a friendly settlement agreement in accordance with which company V. agreed that the applicant company would retain ownership of the building in exchange for MDL 325,092 (approximately EUR 19,328). 16.  On 20 March 2008, within the framework of the review proceedings, the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the parties' request to settle the case. It confirmed the friendly settlement agreement between the applicant company and company V., and on that basis it quashed its previous judgment and rejected the Prosecutor General's action. 17.  It is unclear from the materials of the case and the parties' submissions whether after the adoption of the judgment of 11 October 2007 by the Supreme Court of Justice, company B. returned to the applicant company the amount received as a result of the transaction of 25 April 2003.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Kyiv. 6.  At the time of the events he was the director of a private company. 7.  In August 2002 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of tax evasion and forgery in office. Subsequently, the tax-evasion charge was dropped. 8.  On 7 December 2004 the Kyiv Dniprovskyy District Court (""the Dniprovskyy Court"") found the applicant guilty of forgery in office. It held that he had entered knowingly false data in the company's tax returns. More specifically, instead of applying a straight-line depreciation method in respect of the company's intangible assets, the applicant calculated their depreciation costs as the difference between the company's gross revenues and expenses. As a result, the documents showed the absence of any profit or loss in the company's activity, whereas in the reality it had had losses. The applicant was sentenced to one year's restriction of liberty (namely detention in a semi-open penal institution by the place of his residence) with a ban on holding administrative posts for one year. The sentence was suspended on probation for one year. The applicant was under an undertaking not to leave the town until the judgment became final. 9.  The applicant appealed. He submitted that the activity of the company had been subject to numerous tax inspections, which had not found any violations of the tax legislation. He therefore contended that he had not done anything criminal and that that fact had not received due attention of the first-instance court. Furthermore, the applicant considered that the expert questioned in the trial did not have adequate qualification. Lastly, he argued that the tax police investigator, who had also been questioned, was not impartial and that his statements should not have been relied on. Accordingly, the applicant requested the appellate court to quash the first‑instance court's judgment and to pronounce a new one, acquitting him for the lack of the constituent elements of a crime in his actions. 10.  On 10 February 2005 the Dniprovskyy Court sent a letter to the Kyiv City Court of Appeal (""the Court of Appeal"") stating as follows:
""The [Dniprovskyy Court] is sending you the criminal case regarding [the applicant] convicted under Article 366 § 1 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine [forgery in office], for the appellate examination at 10.35 a.m. on 17 March 2005."" 11.  In addition to the president of the Court of Appeal, the above letter was also addressed to the prosecutor, the applicant and his lawyer. There is no evidence in the case file as to whether the applicant and/or his lawyer received it. According to the applicant, they were unaware of its existence. 12.  On 17 March 2005, following a hearing held with the prosecutor's participation, but in the absence of both the applicant and his lawyer, the appellate court rejected the applicant's appeal. It delivered its ruling ""having heard the report of the judge-rapporteur of the appellate court and the explanations of the prosecutor, the latter considering the judgment lawful and [the applicant's] appeal groundless, having checked the case-file materials and having discussed the arguments advanced in the appeal"". The issue of the applicant's and his lawyer's absence from the hearing was not mentioned in the appellate court's ruling. 13.  The applicant appealed on points of law, challenging, among other things, the examination of his case on appeal in his and his lawyer's absence as being in breach of his defence rights. 14.  On 23 January 2007 the Supreme Court, in written proceedings, upheld the decisions of the lower courts. Referring to the case-file materials, it noted that the first-instance court had informed the applicant and his lawyer about the scheduled appellate hearing, without further details.

Protection of property 

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. 

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Budenovsk, the Stavropol Region of the Russian Federation. He is a former military officer. 6.  On an unspecified date the applicant sued his former employer military unit. 7.  On 3 May 2001 the Military Court of the Pyatigorsk Garrison (""the military court"") ordered, inter alia, the head of the respondent military unit to re-calculate the period of the applicant's service, applying the favourable terms of such calculation for the time when the applicant had participated in a military operation. The military court obliged the head of the military unit to issue the relevant orders, to calculate and to pay the applicant some additional payments and field allowance for the periods specified in the judgment. The judgment contained information on the indexes and other parameters that should be applied for the awarded amounts to be calculated. 8.  On 14 May 2001 the judgment came into force. 9.  In March 2002 the applicant obtained the writ of execution and submitted it to the Department of the Federal Treasury in Budenovsk. 10.  On 19 March 2002 the Department of the Federal Treasury returned the writ of execution to the applicant on the ground that the military unit did not have an account there, and the judgment contained no specific amounts awarded to the applicant. 11.  On 21 March 2002 the applicant submitted the writ of execution to the bailiffs' service. On the same day the enforcement proceedings were initiated. 12.  On 19 February 2003 the enforcement proceedings were terminated and the writ was returned to the applicant without enforcement following his request to withdraw the writ. 13.  In 2004-2005 the applicant applied to the domestic courts for clarification of the initial judgment with the view to establish the specific amounts due to him. The applicant's requests were dismissed as being lodged out of time. The courts noted that, in any case, the matter concerning the awarded amounts should have been resolved by way of an additional decision rather than clarification of a final judgment, and informed that an application for an additional decision should have been lodged before the entry into force of the main judgment. 14.  It is not disputed between the parties that the judgment of 3 May 2001 remained unenforced in the part concerning the payment to the applicant of the second salary and the field allowances for the periods specified in the judgment. 15.  On 24 March 2016, after communication of the present case, the Ministry of Finance of Russia calculated the amount due to the applicant under the judgment of 3 May 2001. According to this calculation, the main debt amounted to 80,220.74 Russian roubles.

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;

Fact pattern: 6.  The applicants are five Russian nationals. Their personal details are set out in the Appendix. They are members of one family. 7.  Since 1981 the applicants have lived in a flat in an apartment block provided to them under a social tenancy agreement by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. The landlord was under obligation to perform a major overhaul of the apartment block, and the applicants had to make regular payments for the major overhaul. They paid the amounts due. The overhaul had never been performed, allegedly since 1935. 8.  On the dates listed in the Appendix the Orenburgskiy District Court of the Orenburg Region granted their claims, having noted from expert reports that the apartment block was ""64%‒dilapidated"" and its state was ""unsatisfactory"", and that the flat was 64%‒dilapidated. The court found that the applicants' living premises, as well as the common property of the apartment block required a major overhaul. The court ordered the Federal State Institution of the Privolzhsko-Uralskiy Military Circuit to perform the major overhaul of the applicants' flat, as well as of the common property of the apartment block and of the ""devices situated in the living premises and serving for provision of communal services"" in the apartment block, and to pay each applicant 3,000 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. 9.  According to the applicants' observations, on 9 November 2011 the Orenburgskiy District Court awarded the claimants RUB 490,155.43 (approximately 11.681 euros) of compensation of losses. They did not enclose a copy of the judgment or further details as to either the defendant, or the exact list of claimants, the scope of the judgment or its subsequent challenge on appeal by any of the parties. 10.  In 2012 Federal State Treasury Department (Управление) of the Privolzhsko-Uralskiy Military Circuit became a legal successor of the debtor institution. 11.  In 2012 the applicants sued various authorities for penalties for several years of the non-enforcement. By the final judgment of 5 February 2013 the Orenburg Regional Court rejected their claims in full, having found that they were based on an incorrect interpretation of the domestic law and that the applicants had failed to submit a calculation of the penalty. 12.  According to the Government, in December 2013 the applicant's house was included in a regional housing overhaul assistance program. The authorities prepared a project and the budget documentation, which were approved by the experts. 13.  On 13 April 2015 Ms Konstantinova privatized the flat and acquired a title to it. 14.  According to the Government's latest observations of 31 May 2017, the judgments had remained unenforced at the material time.

The fact that the judgments remained unenforced at the material time raises questions about whether the applicants were deprived of their right to a fair trial through an unreasonable delay in enforcement.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Istanbul. 5.  On 20 January 2009 the applicant was arrested and taken into custody. 6.  On 22 January 2009 the Edirne Magistrates' Court placed the applicant in detention on remand on suspicion of forming an organised criminal organisation to commit offences and illegal possession of firearms contrary to Article 13 § 1 of Law no. 6136. 7. On 3 July 2009 the Edirne public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Edirne Assize Court charging the applicant with membership of an organised criminal organisation as well as fraud and robbery. 8.  On 8 July 2009 the Edirne Assize Court held that it had no jurisdiction and referred the case file to the Istanbul Assize Court.

Explanation: The described conditions of detention, including overcrowding, limited privacy for sanitary facilities, and extended period of such detention conditions, raise concerns regarding the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment as outlined in Article 3. The statute firmly establishes that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Given the fact pattern, there is legal ambiguity in determining whether the conditions of the applicant's detention constitute inhuman or degrading treatment. This ambiguity stems from the need to assess the subjective experience of the detainee against the objective conditions described, which is often a complex legal question requiring thorough examination of the details of the case.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2,"This is degrading treatment, but the applicant is not tangibly harmed.

Freedom of expression 

1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. 

2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Slavonski Brod. 6.  The applicant is a local political figure in Slavonski Brod. She was the head of administration for all kindergartens in Slavonski Brod, and during several local elections ran for mayor of that town. While the applicant held the position of head of administration for all kindergartens in Slavonski Brod, Z.B. sought and obtained employment in one of the kindergartens in Slavonski Brod as a teacher. One of the conditions for obtaining such employment was holding Croatian citizenship, and Z.B. presented a certificate confirming such citizenship. At a certain point in time Z.B., as an employee of a kindergarten in Slavonski Brod, was a subordinate of the applicant. In February 2008 Z.B. was appointed head of administration for all kindergartens in Slavonski Brod. 7.  On 23 October 2008 the applicant held a press conference entitled ""All victims of the human resources policy of the mayor of Slavonski Brod, M.D."", where she alleged that the mayor of Slavonski Brod was involved in various irregularities in the employment of civil servants in local public institutions. The applicant thereby also alleged that the mayor had appointed Z.B. as the manager of a kindergarten run by the municipality even though she had used invalid documents and held only citizenship of the former Yugoslavia, and that together the mayor and Z.B. had denied a Croatian war veteran's daughter employment (see paragraph 11 below). 8.  On 24 November 2008 Z.B. instituted a private prosecution against the applicant in the Slavonski Brod Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Slavonskom Bordu) on charges of defamation related to the above-mentioned statement. 9.  During the proceedings the applicant contended that she had wanted to show all irregularities concerning the mayor's employment of local civil servants, and that she had learnt that Z.B. had requested Croatian citizenship only after she had been employed as manager of the kindergarten. The applicant also submitted that a councillor in the local assembly had provided her with certain documents concerning Z.B., including an annulled citizenship certificate. 10.  On 21 May 2010 the Slavonski Brod Municipal Court acquitted the applicant on the grounds that the material obtained during the proceedings showed that Z.B. had been registered in 1985 in the register of births of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which at the time had been one of the former Yugoslav republics. She had been registered as a Croatian citizen on 13 October 2008, whereas she had lodged her application for employment at the kindergarten on 12 February 2008. In the circumstances, the Slavonski Brod Municipal Court considered that the applicant demonstrated the veracity of her statements. 11.  On 23 May 2011, upon an appeal by Z.B., the Slavonski Brod County Court (Županijski sud u Slavonskom Brodu) quashed the first-instance judgment and ordered a retrial, on the grounds that not all of the relevant facts had been properly established. 12.  After a retrial, on 26 January 2012 the Slavonski Brod Municipal Court found the applicant guilty of defamation for having said ""[the mayor] appointed people who are using invalid documents to crucial positions, for example Z.B., who unfortunately still has citizenship of the former Yugoslavia"" and ""[the mayor], together with his manager [Z.B.], fired a girl on the pretence that, as the child of a [Croatian] war veteran, she had no right to preferential treatment with regard to employment"". The applicant was given a suspended sentence of sixty days' imprisonment with a probation period of one year. The Slavonski Brod Municipal Court held that it was a well-known fact that Yugoslavia no longer existed, and that therefore Z.B. could not have Yugoslav citizenship. Moreover, Z.B. had acquired Croatian citizenship in 1992, but her citizenship certificate had later been annulled in 2008 due to some administrative irregularities, and later she had been issued with a new certificate. The Slavonski Brod Municipal Court therefore held that the applicant had uttered untrue information concerning Z.B. in public, amounting to defamation. The applicant was also ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings in the amount of 8,250 Croatian kunas (HRK). 13.  The applicant appealed, and on 30 May 2012 the Slavonski Brod County Court dismissed her appeal, upholding the first-instance judgment. 14.  The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), complaining, inter alia, that her freedom of expression had been violated by the judgments of the lower courts. 15.  On 26 September 2012 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant's constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. 16.  The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant's representative on 11 October 2012. 17.  On 4 October 2007 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted Resolution 1577 (2007), ""Towards decriminalisation of defamation"", in which it urged those member States which still allowed prison sentences for defamation, even if those sentences were not actually imposed, to abolish them without delay.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicants, Mr Makhlyagin and Mr Belyayev, were born in 1983 and 1979 respectively and were held in different detention facilities. The facilities' officials opened and/or inspected letters that the applicants exchanged with the Court. 5.  From September 2008 until October 2009 the applicant, detained in a correctional colony, lodged several letters with the Court. All of them were accompanied by cover letters from a chief officer of the colony summarising the content of the applicant's letters. Some letters also bore the colony's registration stamps. 6.  The applicant lodged a claim, alleging that the colony's staff had impeded his correspondence with the Court. On 22 January 2009 the Tagilstroyevskiy District Court of Nizhniy Tagil dismissed his claim 7.  The applicant lodged an appeal with the Sverdlovskiy Regional Court. On 4 March 2009 the Sverdlovskiy Regional Court rejected his appeal, stating that it should be lodged through the first-instance court. The regional court also noted that the applicant could request that the time-limit in respect of the appeal be re-set. 8.  On 30 March 2009 the applicant lodged his appeal with the first‑instance court. Instead of requesting that the time-limit in respect of his appeal be re-set the applicant asked the court to restore his case to the list of pending cases. On 9 April 2009 the District Court refused to examine the appeal as belated. 9.  The applicant appealed against this decision. However, he once again lodged his appeal with the Regional Court instead of the first-instance court. His appeal statement did not contain a request for the missed time‑limit to be re-set. The Sverdlovskiy Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal. 10.  On 2 November 2010 the applicant received a letter from the Court; the letter was opened by a member of the remand prison staff. 11.  The applicant lodged a claim for compensation. By a final decision of 7 June 2011 the Tver Regional Court dismissed his claim. The court stated that Russian law did not prohibit the opening of incoming correspondence from the Court.

Fact pattern: 7.  The applicant was born in 1980. He arrived in Russia in 2003. He travelled to Tajikistan on a number of occasions to visit his parents for short periods of time. 8.  On 3 May 2011 the applicant was charged in absentia in Tajikistan with participating in an extremist religious movement, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and an international search and arrest warrant was issued in his name. On 6 May 2011 the Tajik authorities ordered his pre-trial detention. 9.  On 3 November 2013 the applicant was arrested in Moscow and detained. On 4 November 2013 the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow (""the District Court"") ordered his detention pending extradition. 10.

The above judgment was upheld on appeal by the City Court on 24 October 2014. Claims by the applicant under Article 3 of the Convention were dismissed with reference to the District Court's assessment of the case, which took into consideration ""...the nature of the administrative offence, the character of the accused [who was criminally convicted in Russia]... the length of his stay in Russia and other circumstances of the case"". 20.  According to the latest submissions of his representative in 2015, the applicant was still in detention. 21.

Explanation: The facts presented do not clearly indicate a legal ambiguity regarding the application of Protocol 1 Article 1 to the situation. The circumstances describe a specific scenario where the applicant's car and driving license were seized by authorities of the ""Moldovan Republic of Transdniestria"" (""MRT"") for failing to comply with local traffic and customs regulations. The Protocol articulates that possession can be deprived for the public interest, subject to laws and general principles of international law, but also allows for State enforcement of laws necessary to control the use of property in the general interest or to secure payment of penalties. The seizure of the applicant's car and the imposition of a fine, as well as the seizure of the driving license, could be argued as enforcement actions by a local authority to control the use of property and ensure compliance with regulations, which might be considered within the State's rights under the exceptions provided in the Protocol.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant, a Syrian national, was born in 1993 and currently resides in Khartoum, Sudan. 5.  On 24 April 2015 the applicant arrived in Russia, being in possession of a study visa. He enrolled in the Izhevsk State Technical University and had his registered residence in the town of Izhevsk. His visa expired on 26 April 2016. 6.  On 4 May 2016 the applicant applied for refugee status alleging the risks to his life and safety in the light of the on-going conflict in Syria. The request and the subsequent appeals were dismissed by the Russian migration authorities and the courts. 7.  On 8 June 2016 the applicant was arrested and put in detention by the migration authorities. 8.  By a judgment of 9 June 2016 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Izhevsk found the applicant in breach of migration rules, an offence under Article 18.8 § 1.1 of the Code of Administrative Offences, and ordered his expulsion. In order to facilitate enforcement, the court ordered that the applicant be placed in detention. 9.  On 10 June 2016 the Supreme Court of the Udmurtiya Republic upheld the lower court's judgment. 10.  On 22 June 2016 the Court indicated to the respondent Government, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that the applicant should not be extradited, expelled or otherwise involuntarily removed from Russia to Syria for the duration of the proceedings before the Court. Since that date the enforcement of the applicant's expulsion was monthly postponed by the domestic courts. 11.  On 13 January 2017 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on appeal amended the lower courts' judgments and excluded administrative removal from the sanction, since it would have exposed the applicant's life to risk in Syria. 12.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Ivanovo. 6.  At the relevant time the applicant was a member of the Ivanovo Region electoral commission. 7.  On 23 October 2003 a deputy head of the Ivanovo Region Department of Internal Affairs ordered audio-visual ""surveillance"" (""наблюдение"") of the applicant's office. The parties did not submit a copy of that decision. 8.  The surveillance was carried out from 27 October to 5 November 2003 by means of a hidden camera. 9.  The applicant was subsequently charged with abuse of power, an offence under Article 285 of the Criminal Code. While studying the criminal case file he discovered that it contained video recordings of him talking on the telephone in his office. 10.  At the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty. He claimed, in particular, that the video recordings were inadmissible as evidence as they had been obtained unlawfully without prior judicial authorisation. He also challenged the authenticity of the recordings. 11.  On 27 September 2004 the Leninskiy District Court of Ivanovo convicted the applicant of abuse of power and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment, suspended for two years.

Explanation: There is legal ambiguity present in whether the surveillance of the applicant's office was carried out in accordance with the law and whether it was necessary in a democratic society for one of the reasons listed in Article 8(2). The fact pattern does not provide clear evidence that the surveillance was authorized by a court or performed under lawful exceptions. Additionally, the applicant's claims that the recordings were obtained unlawfully without prior judicial authorization raise questions regarding the adherence to the stipulations of Article 8. Thus, the ambiguity revolves around whether the state's action was justified under the exceptions provided by Article 8(2) and whether it adhered to the due process of law.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,2,"Surveillance infringes upon the applicant's private life, but its usage prevented crime and upheld morals.

Prohibition of torture 

No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Opaci. 6.  On 29 July 2009, the applicant was celebrating his birthday with a group of friends by a lake when they were attacked by S. who was intoxicated and carrying a hunting rifle. S. was angry because the applicant and his friends had allegedly ill-treated his uncle earlier. During the conflict, S. hit one of the applicant's friends with the barrel of his gun and fired four gunshots at the group's cars parked nearby. The applicant attempted to prevent S. from continuing shooting but was shot from a distance of some five metres into his right calf. The applicant's repeated attempts to disarm S. resulted in his receiving two more gunshots from a very short distance into his already wounded leg. 7.  As a result of the attack the applicant sustained serious injuries to his right leg which led to amputation of his leg above the knee. 8.  On 31 July 2009 criminal proceedings were instituted against S. on charges of hooliganism with the use of a firearm resulting in the causing of severe harm to the applicant's health. 9.  Between 1 and 10 August 2009 twenty-five witnesses were questioned and by 12 September 2009 most of the investigative measures were completed. 10.  On 12 August 2009 S. was declared a suspect in the criminal proceedings and on 29 December 2009 he was indicted. 11.  On 12 January 2010 S. was heard as an accused. He acknowledged his guilt, but refused to make any declarations. 12.  On 23 February 2010 the criminal case-file was remitted for examination from the Căușeni Police Station to the Anenii Noi Police Station. 13.  Between March and December 2010 the Anenii Noi police conducted a new investigation into the circumstances of the case and carried out again all the investigative measures. 14.  On 14 December 2010 the case-file was transmitted to the Anenii Noi prosecutor's office with the proposal to be remitted to a court for consideration. 15.  On 20 December 2010 both the applicant and his representative were notified of the completion of the criminal investigation. 16.  On 30 December 2010 the prosecutor's office decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings against S. The prosecutor's office found that according to Article 63(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a person's status as suspect cannot be maintained longer than three months. Since S. was indicted on 29 December 2009, that is four months and seventeen days later, the indictment was unlawful. Therefore, all charges against S. were dropped and the proceedings discontinued. 17.  On 18 February 2011 at the request of the applicant's representative, the prosecutor general's office decided to annul its previous decision of 30 December 2010, and to resume the criminal investigation on the ground that new facts had been discovered. 18.  On 31 March 2011 the Rascani District Court upheld S.'s objection against the prosecutor's decision of 18 February 2011, ordering its annulment. The applicant and his representative were not summoned or informed about the proceedings.

Statute: Article 6 

Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; 
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant company, Virprod-Lux S.R.L., is a company incorporated in Moldova. 6.  On 13 April 2000 the Tax Authority seized a building from a State‑owned company, company V., on account of taxes which were due. 7.  On 1 October 2000, at the request of the Tax Authority, the building was valued by an estate agency at 352,000 Moldovan lei (MDL). 8.  On 29 January 2001 the Department of Privatisation and Administration of State Property sold the building in question to company B. for MDL 360,500 (approximately 29,678 Euros (EUR), following a public auction. 9.  On 25 April 2003 the applicant company bought the building from company B. for MDL 628,000 (approximately EUR 22,053). 10.  On 29 March 2007 the Prosecutor General's Office initiated court proceedings in which it sought the annulment of both the sale of the building on 29 January 2001 and the subsequent transaction between company B. and the applicant company. It also sought the return of the building to its initial owner, company V. The reason relied upon by the Prosecutor's General's Office was that the valuation of the building conducted by the estate agency had not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of the law. The applicant company opposed the Prosecutor General's action and argued, among other things, that it was time-barred. 11.  On 21 August 2007 the Economic Court of Appeal dismissed the Prosecutor General's action as time-barred. The court held, inter alia, that in accordance with the statute of limitations, the Prosecutor General's action could not be initiated more than three years after the events in dispute had taken place. 12.  On 11 October 2007 the Supreme Court of Justice upheld an appeal by the Prosecutor General, reversed the judgment of the Economic Court of Appeal, and upheld the action in its entirety. The Supreme Court considered that the Prosecutor General's action concerned a declaration of the absolute nullity of the contracts in question and that therefore, in accordance with Article 217 of the Civil Code, enacted on 12 June 2003, it could not be limited in time. Following this judgment, the transactions of 29 January 2001 and 25 April 2003 were annulled and each party involved was ordered to return to the other parties whatever they received by virtue of those transactions. 13.  On 7 December 2007 the applicant company lodged a revision request against the above judgment in which it indicated that it had carried out an expert evaluation of the disputed building by an independent expert who determined its value at MDL 8,550,000 (approximately EUR 511,440) after the improvements made by the applicant company to it. 14.  In the meantime, the applicant company did not leave the disputed building because it had its production line there and it needed time and resources to find another suitable building and to move its production line. 15.  Since company V. did not need the disputed building, the applicant company proposed to it and the latter accepted to conclude a friendly settlement agreement in accordance with which company V. agreed that the applicant company would retain ownership of the building in exchange for MDL 325,092 (approximately EUR 19,328). 16.  On 20 March 2008, within the framework of the review proceedings, the Supreme Court of Justice upheld the parties' request to settle the case. It confirmed the friendly settlement agreement between the applicant company and company V., and on that basis it quashed its previous judgment and rejected the Prosecutor General's action. 17.  It is unclear from the materials of the case and the parties' submissions whether after the adoption of the judgment of 11 October 2007 by the Supreme Court of Justice, company B. returned to the applicant company the amount received as a result of the transaction of 25 April 2003.

Explanation: Applying Article 6 to the fact pattern, there doesn’t appear to be legal ambiguity in the application of the statute. The statute mandates the right to a fair trial, which encompasses various procedural rights, including being informed of charges, preparing a defense, and having a fair hearing. The fact pattern describes a legal dispute involving the sale and subsequent annulment of transactions related to a building. The disputes went through several levels of judicial review, including appeals and a friendly settlement agreement approved by the Supreme Court of Justice. The process involved adheres to the procedural mandates for a fair trial as outlined in Article 6, including the right to appeal and the ultimate resolution of the dispute through legal processes. The parties were given opportunities to present their case, argue against actions they deemed unjust, and ultimately reach a resolution through the courts, including an appeal process.

Freedom of expression 

1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises. 

2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Diyarbakır. 6.  On 30 September 2007 a reading out of a press statement and a march were held in Diyarbakır in order to protest about the conditions of detention and alleged poisoning of Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party), an illegal armed organisation. The protesters gathered in front of the building of the Diyarbakır branch of the Democratic Society Party (Demokratik Toplum Partisi) (DTP) where a press statement was read out. They then marched. The applicant, as a member of the DTP, participated in the gathering and the ensuing march. According to a police report dated 9 October 2007, the applicant was seen while carrying a banner which read ""İnsanlık zehirleniyor"" (""The humanity is being poisoned"") and applauding together with other demonstrators in the police video footage. 7.  On 9 October 2007 the applicant was taken into police custody. On the same day she was detained on remand. 8.  On 17 October 2007 the Diyarbakır public prosecutor charged the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) on account of the content of the banner she had carried during the demonstration of 30 September 2007. 9.  On 4 December 2007 the applicant was released pending trial. 10.  On 18 March 2008 the Diyarbakır Assize Court convicted the applicant as charged. The court found it established, on the basis of an expert report on the police video footage, that the applicant had been together with other persons who had chanted the slogan ""Be Serok Jiyan Nabe"" (""There is no life without the leader"") and that she had carried a banner which read ""The humanity is being poisoned"". The applicant was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment. 11.  On 9 January 2012 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 18 March 2008. 12.  On an unspecified date the applicant started serving her prison sentence. On 17 July 2012, upon the applicant's request, the Diyarbakır Assize Court ordered her release from prison, in accordance with Law no. 6352 which had entered into force on 5 July 2012 and which had amended certain provisions of Law no. 3713.

During the events which led to the fall of the communist regime, on the night of 21/22 December 1989 the applicant's son was killed by gunfire in Bucharest. 7.  In 1990 the military prosecutor's office opened several investigations into the December 1989 armed crackdown on the anti-communism demonstrations. A main criminal investigation concerning the use of violence against civilians in Bucharest and other cities was registered with the highest prosecutor's office – the military prosecutors section − under no. 97/P/1990 (current number 11/P/2014). In the main criminal investigation the applicant raised civil claims and asked that the perpetrators of the offence of homicide committed against her son be identified and punished. 8.  At the same time, another investigation concerning the offences of complicity in seriously aggravated homicide and complicity in attempted seriously aggravated homicide, committed against a large number of persons, including the applicant's son, culminated in the committal for trial of public officials, members of the ruling political party, and their subsequent conviction by a final decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 20 April 1992. 9.   The relevant procedural steps taken in the main criminal investigation were described in the cases Association ""21 December 1989"" and Others (cited above, §§ 12-41) and Sidea and Others v.

On 14 October 2015 the military prosecutor's office closed the main criminal investigation, finding that the applicant's complaint regarding the offence of homicide committed against her son was statute-barred and that a complaint concerning instigation of homicide was a matter of res judicata following the Supreme Court of Justice's decision of 20 April 1992 (see paragraph 8 above). 11.  The decision of 14 October 2015 was subsequently annulled by a Prosecutor General's decision of 5 April 2016, confirmed by the High Court of Cassation and Justice on 13 June 2016.

Explanation: The fact pattern describes a situation where the applicant's son was killed by gunfire during anti-communism demonstrations, leading to criminal investigations into the use of violence against civilians. The legal ambiguity arises from determining whether the use of force resulting in the son's death could be justified under Article 2(2), specifically whether it was ""no more than absolutely necessary"" in action lawfully taken to quell a riot or insurrection. Given that the descriptions of the events and subsequent legal proceedings are complex and involve assessments of the necessity and lawfulness of the force used, there is potential ambiguity in applying the statute to these facts without further detailed evidence regarding the circumstances of the use of force.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,"The applicant's son was deprived of his life as a result of more force than absolutely necessary, according to the aggravated homicide case.",FALSE,N/A,lack info,FALSE

Right to a fair trial 

1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; 
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; 
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Poltava. 6.  On 18 April 2003 the applicant's employer, Grebinkivska District State Administration (""the Administration""), received a statement from the Grebinkivskyy District prosecutor's office dated 17 April 2003 (""the prosecutor's statement""). The document analysed the amount of preventive social work performed by the applicant in connection with minors in 2002 and concluded that the applicant, as the head of the juvenile service department of the Administration, had no knowledge of the relevant law and displayed an irresponsible attitude towards her professional duties. The document contained a demand that the applicant be disciplined. 7.  On 21 April 2003 the Administration examined the prosecutor's statement and decided to give the applicant a warning against the use of excessive formalism in her work. On 14 May 2003 the Administration informed the prosecutor's office of the actions taken in consequence of their consideration of the prosecutor's statement. 8.  On 10 April 2004 the applicant brought civil defamation proceedings against the Grebinkivskyy District prosecutor's office, Prosecutor Mr B., the Poltava Region prosecutor's office and the State Treasury of Ukraine, alleging that the prosecutor's statement contained untrue information relating to her professional activity and that this negative evaluation of her attitude to work had damaged her honour, dignity and professional reputation. She asked the court to order the Grebinkivskyy District prosecutor's office to retract the prosecutor's statement and to pay her compensation for non-pecuniary damage. 9.  On 8 December 2005 the Pyryatynskyy District Court of Poltava Region applied defamation law as contained in the Civil Code of 2003, the Prosecutor's Office Act and the Information Act. It considered the case on its merits and allowed the applicant's claim in part. 10.  On 17 July 2006 the Poltava Regional Court of Appeal did not challenge the approach of the first-instance court in considering the case under civil law defamation provisions. However, it disagreed with the application of the Civil Code of 2003 and applied the old Civil Code of 1963. It partly allowed the claim and increased the level of compensation awarded to the applicant for non-pecuniary damage. 11.  On 20 September 2006 the State Treasury of Ukraine appealed against the decision to the Supreme Court. 12.  On 6 February 2008 the Supreme Court of Ukraine quashed the above decision of 17 July 2006 and closed the proceedings, finding that the case should not have been examined in civil proceedings. The court indicated that the prosecutor's statement should have been contested either before a superior prosecutor (in accordance with section 22 of the Prosecutor's Act) or before ""a court"". The Supreme Court also ruled that, according to paragraph 4 of Resolution no. 7 of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of Ukraine dated 28 September 1990, entitled ""on the application of legislation by the courts regulating defence of honour, dignity and reputation of citizens and organisations"" (""the Resolution""), it was not possible to file a civil defamation claim in respect of statements contained in courts' decisions or decisions of various investigative bodies.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant company is a limited liability company incorporated under Moldovan Law. 6.  On 24 December 2012 and 21 June 2013 respectively the applicant company initiated two sets of civil proceedings challenging two decisions issued by the State Tax Inspectorate of Străşeni (Inspectoratul Fiscal de Stat Străşeni – ""the Inspectorate"") under which it had been fined for non‑compliance with the VAT reporting regulations. On 5 September 2013 these two sets of proceedings were joined. 7.  On 26 December 2013 the Străşeni District Court upheld the applicant company's claims and overturned the impugned decisions. The representative of the Inspectorate was not present when the judgment was delivered, despite having been duly informed of the date and the time of the hearing. 8.  On 5 February 2014 the Inspectorate lodged an appeal against the judgment of the Străşeni District Court. No request for an extension of the legal time-limit for lodging an appeal was made. The applicant company objected to the appeal and argued that it had been lodged outside the thirty‑day time-limit and that the Inspectorate had not requested an extension of the legal time-limit for lodging it. 9.  In a decision of 3 September 2014 the Chişinău Court of Appeal calculated the applicable time-limit and found that it had expired on 27 January 2014 and, accordingly, that the Inspectorate had been late in lodging its appeal. It therefore decided to strike the appeal out of its list of cases as time-barred. The Inspectorate lodged an appeal on points of law against that decision. It argued that the Chişinău Court of Appeal could not strike out the appeal after having commenced its examination of the merits of the case. 10.  On 8 October 2014 the Supreme Court of Justice quashed the Chişinău Court of Appeal's strike-out decision of 3 September 2014. Without contesting the Court of Appeal's calculation of the time-limit for lodging the appeal, the Supreme Court of Justice accepted the argument put forward by the Inspectorate and found that the Court of Appeal had breached the rules of procedure by adopting a strike-out decision after having started an examination of the merits of the case. Ultimately, the case was referred back to the Chişinău Court of Appeal for re-examination. 11.  On 28 January 2015, after rehearing the case, the Chişinău Court of Appeal upheld the Inspectorate's appeal, quashed the judgment of the Străşeni District Court of 26 December 2013 and rendered a new judgment whereby the applicant company's action was rejected as ill-founded. 12.  On 10 June 2015 the Supreme Court of Justice declared an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant company inadmissible.

Explanation: The provided fact pattern and the statute do not indicate a legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the facts. The case primarily revolves around procedural matters such as time limits for filing appeals and procedural breaches related to when a court can strike out an appeal. The core issue does not relate to the fair trial rights outlined in the statute, such as the independence and impartiality of the tribunal, the public pronouncement of judgment, or the specific rights of individuals charged with criminal offenses, such as the right to be informed of the charge, to have adequate time and facilities for defense preparation, to defend oneself, to examine witnesses, or to have the assistance of an interpreter.

Protection of property 

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. 

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Lipetsk. 6.  On 18 September 2007 the applicant signed a private contract for the purchase of a flat in Lipetsk. The seller was Ms E.M.T., acting on behalf of herself and her daughter Maria, a minor. The contract stipulated that the property was not ""mortgaged, encumbered by any claims of third parties, disputed or charged"". 7.  The flat in question had been allocated as social housing to Ms E.M.T. and her husband, Mr V.A.V., in 1979. They had lived there with their four children: Yelena, Mikhail, Dmitriy and Maria. Mikhail and Dmitriy were given long prison sentences in 1998 and 2004 respectively and were still serving them at the material time. Yelena moved out in 1997 to continue her studies in Dagestan. In 2006, Ms E.M.T and Maria became the sole owners of the property by way of privatisation, while Mr V.A.V., Mikhail, Dmitry and Yelena declined in writing to exercise their right to obtain their shares of the privatised flat. 8.  As the seller Ms E.M.T. delayed submitting the contract for State registration, the applicant sought a court order upholding her full title to the property. The seller Ms E.M.T. brought a counterclaim. She submitted that she was unable to move out because the purchase of the new flat for herself and her daughter Maria had not yet been finalised. However, after Ms E.M.T. failed to appear in court, on 2 April 2008 the Oktyabrskiy District Court in Lipetsk struck out the counterclaim and granted the applicant relief in the form of an order compelling State registration of her full title to the property. On 12 November 2008 the title was registered. 9.  The applicant then sued the former owner Ms E.M.T. and members of her family, seeking termination of their right to use the flat, annulment of the registration of their residence at that address, and their eviction. 10.  On 7 April 2009 the Oktyabrskiy District Court allowed her claim in part. It ordered the eviction of Ms E.M.T. and Maria, as they were no longer owners of the property, but dismissed the claim in respect of Yelena, Mikhail and Dmitriy on the following grounds:
""According to the parties, the contested property contains personal belongings and chattels of the defendants [Mikhail, Dmitriy and Yelena]; it appears from their written statements that, in declining their shares of the contested property during its privatisation, they did not intend to stop using the flat. Since there was no arrangement between the owner of the contested property and the defendants regarding the discontinuation of the right to use the property, the court considers that [Mikhail, Dmitriy and Yelena] had a right of use over the flat which was identical [in its scope] to that of the owner; accordingly, there are no legal grounds for allowing [the applicant's] claim to declare their right of use over the flat terminated.
A change in ownership of the contested property cannot serve as an independent ground for terminating [their] right to use the flat ...
The plaintiff's argument to the effect that [Mikhail, Dmitriy and Yelena] do not actually live in the contested property cannot serve as an independent ground for terminating [their] right of use over the flat ...
Since the defendants' right of use over the flat is not terminated, there are no grounds for ordering their eviction ..."" 11.  On 27 May 2009 the Lipetsk Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal, endorsing the District Court's judgment.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Grimăncăuți. 6.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7.  The applicant is a farmer who grows and sells potatoes. On 5 February 2008 he and his brother went to the Varnița village, in the vicinity of the city of Bender/Tighina. The latter is controlled by the authorities of the self-proclaimed ""Moldovan Republic of Transdiestria"" (""the MRT""), while Varnița itself is under Moldovan control. 8.  Having sold potatoes for some time in various places in Varnița, with authorisation from the local administration, on 5 February 2008 at around 2.30 p.m. the applicant was approached by plain clothed officers of the ""MRT"" customs authority. The latter asked for documents for the merchandise, including evidence of payment of taxes for importing merchandise into the ""MRT"". The applicant explained that he had all the relevant documents and had paid taxes to the Moldovan local authorities in Varnița. Shortly thereafter two more officers from the ""MRT"" security and customs authorities arrived in a car. When the applicant's brother announced that he had called the Moldovan police, the applicant was attacked by the ""MRT"" officers, forced into their car and driven away. The Moldovan police arrived after the impugned event. 9.  Later in the evening, the applicant's car with the remainder of merchandise was seized by the ""MRT"" customs authority. According to the applicant, an officer of the Moldovan police was present and did not interfere. 10.  On 6 February 2008 the Bender city court (an ""MRT"" court) found the applicant guilty of having committed the administrative offence of resistance to the customs officers. The applicant explained that he considered having been arrested on Moldovan territory (Varnița village) and not having seen any signs warning that he was about to cross into the territory under the ""MRT"" control. The court sentenced him to three days' detention. According to the applicant, the hearing took place in Russian, a language which he understood only to a limited degree, and in the absence of a translator. He was refused the right to be assisted by a lawyer when preparing for the hearing, and a court-appointed lawyer was only present at the court hearing, not assisting him in any manner. The applicant was given neither a copy of the record of his arrest prior to its examination by the court, nor a copy of the court decision of 6 February 2008. 11.  The decision was enforced immediately and the applicant served all three days until the evening of 8 February 2008, when he was released. He could recover his car and merchandise at 11 p.m. on the same day. 12.  On 15 February 2008 the applicant lodged a summary appeal against the decision of the first-instance court, noting that he would submit a full appeal once he received a copy of the decision of 6 February 2008. At his request, on 17 March 2008 he obtained a copy of that decision. 13.  On 18 March 2008 the ""MRT"" Supreme Court quashed the lower court's decision because of the failure to specify the exact place where the offence had been committed. The case was sent for re-examination by the lower court. The applicant was not informed of that decision. On 25 April 2008 the ""MRT"" Supreme Court accepted an extraordinary appeal lodged by the president of that court's chair and decided that the case was to be re-examined by that court. The applicant was not informed of that decision. 14.  On 27 May 2008 the applicant received by fax a letter dated 12 May 2008 summoning him to the hearing of the ""MRT"" Supreme Court on 27 May 2008 at 10 a.m. Because of this late summoning he could not appear at the hearing. On the same day the court rejected the applicant's appeal against the decision of 6 February 2008, finding that he had been arrested on the territory of the city of Bender after refusing to abide by orders of the ""MRT"" customs authority. 15.  On 6 February 2008 the applicant's brother made a criminal complaint in the applicant's name to various Moldovan authorities, including the Prosecutor General's Office, about the applicant's unlawful arrest by officers from the ""MRT"". He asked for the criminal prosecution of those responsible. 16.  On 7 February 2008 the applicant's brother sent a complaint about the applicant's abduction by the ""MRT"" authorities to the embassies of several countries in Moldova, including that of the Russian Federation. On 11 February 2008 the applicant sent letters to various embassies, including that of the Russian Federation, thanking them for their intervention into the case by bringing the matter before the Joint Control Commission.[1] Following this alleged intervention the applicant's car and merchandise were returned to him. 17.  On 28 February 2008 the Moldovan police station in Bender started a criminal investigation into the applicant's abduction by ""MRT"" officers. Several witnesses confirmed that the applicant had been forcibly taken away in a car from near a bar in Varnița village and that two of the ""MRT"" officers were identified. In view of the Moldovan prosecuting authorities' inability to effectively prosecute persons on the territory controlled of the ""MRT"", on 28 August 2008, the investigation was suspended. On 30 May 2013 the investigation was resumed and was pending by the time of the last submissions made to the Court (December 2013). The parties did not inform the Court of any subsequent developments in that regard.

Several witnesses confirmed that the applicant had been forcibly taken away in a car from near a bar in Varnița village and that two of the ""MRT"" officers were identified. In view of the Moldovan prosecuting authorities' inability to effectively prosecute persons on the territory controlled of the ""MRT"", on 28 August 2008, the investigation was suspended.

Explanation: The fact pattern indicates several areas of legal ambiguity in relation to the applicant's right to a fair trial as outlined in Article 6. Firstly, the applicant was tried in a language that he only partially understood without the assistance of a translator, potentially compromising his ability to fully comprehend the proceedings. Secondly, he was denied adequate time and facilities to prepare his defense, as indicated by his inability to be assisted by a lawyer during the preparation phase and the court-appointed lawyer's lack of assistance. Additionally, the re-examination process and notification of decisions were handled in a way that seemed to exclude the applicant effectively, further impairing his right to a fair trial. Furthermore, the overarching issue of jurisdiction and the control exercised by ""MRT"" authorities in a region with ambiguous sovereignty raises questions about the legality and fairness of the trial conducted by the ""MRT"" court. Thus, there is legal ambiguity in the application of the statute to the fact pattern, particularly concerning the fair trial rights of the individual involved.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,"The applicant was denied his right to an interpreter, a lawyer for defence, and to be informed promptly of charges against him.",FALSE,N/A,incorrect concl,TRUE

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Yekaterinburg. 5.  On 13 May 2009 he was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery. On the following day the Verkh-Isetskiy District Court in Yekaterinburg remanded him in custody and set the time-limit until 12 July 2009. 6.  On 13 July 2009 the District Court granted a two-month extension of the detention period. However, on 31 July 2009 the Sverdlovsk Regional Court quashed the extension order as it had been issued outside the authorised detention period, and ordered the applicant's release. 7.  The applicant was not released. He was not allowed to leave the police ward and was re-arrested on the charge of theft. The arrest record mentioned the charge, without specifying when or where the theft had been committed or why the applicant was suspected of it. 8.  On 2 August 2009 the District Court adjourned the detention hearing for seventy-two hours, at the request from the applicant's counsel. On 4 August 2009 the District Court issued a detention order which did not set a time-limit for the applicant's detention or give any assessment to the existence of a ""reasonable suspicion"" against the applicant.  On 2 September 2009 the Regional Court upheld the detention order on appeal. 9.  Further extensions of the applicant's detention were granted by the Leninskiy District Court on 29 September, 20 October and 2 November 2009. The last extension order was issued in the absence of the parties. On 25 November 2009 the Regional Court found that extension order unlawful and set it aside, but extended the applicant's detention for a future period. 10.  On 23 December 2009 the Bogdanovichi Town Court in the Sverdlovsk Region opened the trial and extended the applicant's detention. The applicant's appeal against the extension order was rejected by the Regional Court on 11 June 2010. 11.  On 2 March and 22 April 2010 the Town Court extended the applicant's detention. Each time the court referred to the gravity of the charges and the applicant's criminal record. The appeals against the orders were rejected on 30 June and 11 June, respectively. 12.  Throughout the trial the applicant was held in a metal cage. 13.  On 13 May 2010 the applicant was found guilty of theft and armed robbery and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. On 18 August 2010 the Regional Court upheld the conviction but reduced the sentence to three years' imprisonment. 14.  On 24 June 2010 the applicant's mother died. His request to be allowed to attend the funeral was rejected by the governor of the IZ-66/1 remand prison and upheld by the courts on the ground that remand prisoners did not have the benefit of a leave of absence under Russian law. When his father died on 5 November 2010, the director of the correctional colony in Sosnovoborsk in the Krasnoyarsk Region also refused his request for a short-term absence, on account of the funeral being held outside of the region where the colony was located. 15.  The Sosnovoborsk colony was located some 2,400 kilometres away from Yekaterinburg where the applicant's family lived.

Explanation: The fact pattern demonstrates potential legal ambiguities in applying the statute regarding the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time. The proceedings from the initial filing to the Supreme Court's dismissal span over a decade, which raises concerns about whether the duration could be considered reasonable under Article 6. Issue could also be found with the sufficiency of the remedy provided by the Constitutional Court, questioning if the awarded compensation is adequate for the long duration and potential impact on the plaintiffs' lives. These aspects introduce legal ambiguities regarding the interpretation and application of what constitutes a ""reasonable time"" for a hearing and how to adequately address violations of this right.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1,"While it depends on the definition of ""reasonable time,"" it appears, according to the Constitutional Court, that the applicant did not receive a hearing within a reasonable time.",FALSE,correct,N/A,FALSE

Prohibition of torture 

No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Novocheboksarsk. 6.  The facts of the applicant's ill-treatment in police custody were established in a judgment of the Novocheboksarsk Town Court of the Chuvash Republic (""the Town Court"") of 22 August 2008 and upheld on 11 November 2008 by the Supreme Court of the Chuvash Republic. The facts are as follows. 7.  On 10 April 2007 the applicant was stopped by police officers on a street near his home and taken to district police station no. 1 of Novocheboksarsk to have his identity checked. At the police station a district police officer (участковый уполномоченный милиции), Officer M. from the Novocheboksarsk town police station, who wore a police uniform, threatened the applicant by saying that a criminal case against him would be opened, grabbed him by his clothing, violently pushed him backwards against a wall several times and punched his left ear. 8.  According to a forensic medical expert's report, the applicant had a traumatic rupture of the left eardrum with a haemorrhage, which caused a short-term – lasting between six and twenty-one days – health disorder. Accordingly, this qualified as ""insignificant"" health damage. 9.  Officer M. was convicted under Article 286 § 3 (a) of the Criminal Code (abuse of power with the use of violence) and sentenced to three years' imprisonment and a two‑year ban on exercising official power. 10.  In January 2009 the applicant brought a civil claim in the amount of 312,487 Russian roubles (RUB) against the Ministry of Finance of the Chuvash Republic in respect of non-pecuniary damage. He argued, inter alia, that his ill‑treatment by the police had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (""the Convention""), and that, in accordance with the Plenary Supreme Court Resolution no. 5 of 10 October 2003, the domestic courts were to apply the Convention in accordance with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (""the Court""). He also argued that, in calculating the amount of compensation due in respect of non‑pecuniary damage for a violation of the Convention, the domestic courts therefore had to take into account the sums awarded by the Court under Article 41 of the Convention in similar cases. He stated that his claim had been calculated based on the sum awarded by the Court in the case of Ribitsch, in which a violation of Article 3 of the Convention had been found on account of inhuman and degrading treatment in police custody (see Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336). 11.  On 6 April 2009 the Town Court allowed the applicant's civil claim in part. It noted that, under Article 61 § 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a judgment in a criminal case which had become enforceable was binding on a court examining the civil-law consequences of the acts of a person against whom the judgment had been delivered, in so far as it established whether those acts had taken place and whether they had been committed by that person. Article 53 of the Constitution and Articles 151 and 1069 of the Civil Code provided for State liability for harm caused to individuals by State agents. Relying on Articles 1099-1101 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation and section 8 of the Plenary Supreme Court Resolution no. 10 of 20 December 1994, the Town Court held that RUB 20,000 would be just and reasonable satisfaction for the applicant's mental suffering as a result of his ill-treatment by the police officer, treatment which had undermined his honour and dignity and caused him insignificant health damage. 12.  The applicant appealed against the judgment. On 6 May 2009 the Supreme Court of the Chuvash Republic upheld the judgment on appeal, fully endorsing the Town Court's calculation of the amount of compensation in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. It disagreed with the applicant that, in determining the amount of compensation for non‑pecuniary damage, the domestic courts had to be guided by the amounts of such compensation awarded by the Court in similar cases, stating as follows:
""Indeed, in accordance with Article 15 § 4 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, commonly recognised principles and norms of international law and international agreements of the Russian Federation are an integral part of [the Russian Federation's] legal system. However, this does not mean that the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage determined by the European Court of Human Rights in a specific case has a binding effect on national courts examining other cases where a violation of similar norms and principles can be found. The determination of the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage in specific cases is the prerogative of national courts examining such cases.""

The applicant was detained in Mysłowice Remand Centre from 20 April 2010 to 12 January 2011 and in Wojkowice Prison from 12 January 2011 to 9 March 2012 (1 year, 10 months and 20 days). 8.  The parties' statements relating to the conditions of the applicant's detention from 20 April 2010 to 9 March 2012 are to a large extent contradictory. 9.  The applicant submitted that throughout his detention in Mysłowice Remand Centre and Wojkowice Prison, he had been held in overcrowded cells in which the space per person had been below the Polish statutory minimum standard of 3 m². 10.  In their observations, the Government submitted that the applicant had been detained in overcrowded cells only on 20 April, 18 and 19 May 2009. 11.  In the course of civil proceedings instituted by the applicant (see paragraphs 14-16 below), the domestic courts established, without giving any further details, that the applicant had been detained in overcrowded cells from 20 April 2010 to 9 March 2012 (1 year, 10 months and 20 days). 12.  Regarding the conditions of detention in Mysłowice Remand Centre, the domestic court established that the overall conditions in cells were adequate. The applicant had one hot shower per week and one hour of outdoor exercise per day. 13.  Regarding the conditions of detention in Wojkowice Prison, as established by the domestic courts, the toilets were separated from the cell's living area, every prisoner had his own bed, a stool and access to cold running water. The prisoners had basic hygiene products at their disposal. The ceiling was infested with humidity. The applicant had one hot shower per week and one hour of outdoor exercise per day. 14.  On 24 February 2012 the applicant brought a civil action for the infringement of his personal rights on account of inadequate living conditions in Wojkowice Prison from November 2005 to July 2006 and from January to March 2007, in Mysłowice Remand Centre from 20 April 2010 to 12 January 2011 and, subsequently, again in Wojkowice Prison from 12 January 2011 to 9 March 2012. The applicant argued that he had been detained in overcrowded cells, where the space per person had been below the statutory minimum of 3 m². He claimed 80,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approximately 20,000 euros (EUR)) in compensation. 15.  On 18 December 2012 the Katowice Regional Court dismissed the applicant's action, finding that from 20 April 2010 to 9 March 2012 the applicant had been detained in cells above the minimum statutory standard. As regards the remainder of the period, the claim was time-barred as lodged outside the three-year period of statutory limitation. 16.  On 27 June 2013 the Katowice Court of Appeal overruled the lower court's judgment and allowed the applicant's action, finding that from 20 April 2010 to 9 March 2012 he had been detained in overcrowded cells. The court relied in this respect on the applicant's submissions, holding that the State Treasury had in fact acknowledged these by its multiple refusals to provide the first and the second instance courts with an official register of cells in which the applicant had been detained. It also granted the applicant PLN 1,000 (EUR 250) in compensation, holding that the breach of the statutory minimum standard had not been significant.

Explanation: The factual scenario describes the applicant being held in overcrowded cells, with space per person being below the national statutory minimum, representing conditions that could potentially fall under ""inhuman or degrading treatment"" as prohibited by Article 3. The legal ambiguity might seem present regarding what constitutes ""inhuman or degrading treatment."" However, given the established facts that the applicant was subjected to overcrowded conditions for a significant period, which the courts ultimately found to be true and compensated for, it aligns directly with the prohibition in Article 3.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Batumi. 6.  He was a judge at the Khulo District Court. On 12 November 2004 the Supreme Council of Justice initiated disciplinary proceedings against him on the grounds set out in section 2(2)-(a) Act of 22 February 2000 on Disciplinary Proceedings against Judges of Ordinary Courts (hereinafter, ""the Disciplinary Proceedings Act"" – see paragraphs 16 and 17 below). He was accused in particular of having kept a defendant in a criminal case under his consideration in unlawful detention for the period of fourteen days in September 2004, which fact was qualified as a ""manifest breach of the law"" within the meaning of the above-mentioned provision of the Disciplinary Proceedings Act. 7.  On 18 November 2004 a Panel of the Disciplinary Council of Judges (hereinafter, ""the Panel""), composed of Mr K.K. (the President of the Panel and rapporteur), Mr G.Ch., Mr D.S. and Mr I.K., considered the case at an oral hearing. According to the transcript of the hearing, the applicant admitted to the act he had been accused of. After examining the circumstances of the case, the Panel found the applicant guilty of the misconduct in question. Describing the mistake at issue as unacceptable, the Panel decided, despite his lack of prior disciplinary sanctions and his good professional reputation, to remove the applicant from judicial office. 8.  The applicant lodged an appeal with the Disciplinary Council of Judges (hereinafter, ""the Disciplinary Council"") on points of fact and law. He questioned the assessment of the circumstances of the case and the application of the legal provisions to the established facts in the decision of 18 November 2004. 9.  By a decision of 27 January 2005, the Disciplinary Council unanimously upheld the Panel's decision of 18 November 2004 in its entirety. 10.  The applicant appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court of Georgia. In a judgment of 11 July 2005, the Supreme Court quashed the Disciplinary Council's decision of 27 January 2005 for lack of reasoning and legal assessment of the facts, and remitted the case for re-examination. 11.  On 4 August 2005 the Disciplinary Council, composed of six members, including three members, Mr K.K. (President and rapporteur), Mr G.Ch., Mr I.K, who had sat at the first hearing, re-considered the applicant's case; another member of the Disciplinary Council who participated in the examination of the applicant's case was Ms N.K. During the oral hearing, the applicant challenged the above-mentioned three members of the bench – Mr K.K., Mr G.Ch. and Mr I.K – on the ground that they had considered his case when it had come before the Panel on 18 November 2004. The request was dismissed. 12.  After re-considering all the factual circumstances of the case, the Disciplinary Council found, in its decision of 4 August 2005, that the applicant had committed ""a manifest breach of the law"" and upheld the Panel's decision of 18 November 2004 in its entirety. 13.  In his appeal on points of law, the applicant complained that Mr K.K. had presided over all of the benches of both the Disciplinary Council and the Panel, and three of the members sitting on the Disciplinary Council when it ruled on 4 August 2005 had already dealt with the case at first instance on 18 November 2004. He also complained about his request for their withdrawal being rejected. Finally, the applicant criticised the haste with which the case had been considered by the Disciplinary Council. 14.  On 14 November 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's appeal on points of law, finding that the case had been objectively and exhaustively examined by the disciplinary bodies and that the punishment imposed had been appropriate. As for the rest, noting that the Disciplinary Proceedings Act had instituted a system whereby members of the disciplinary panel could also sit on the Disciplinary Council, the Supreme Court concluded that the composition of the benches complained of by the applicant had been perfectly legal. Moreover, in the court's opinion, the fact that the persons concerned had previously participated in the examination of the case was not in itself sufficient to prove that the Disciplinary Council, in its ruling on 4 August 2005, had not been impartial. 15.  According to the materials available in the case file, the applicant did not voice, even in remote terms, either before the Panel, the Disciplinary Council or the Supreme Court any complaint about the lack of professional qualifications by any of the individual members of the Disciplinary Council who had participated in the examination of his case.

Fact pattern: 7.  The applicant was born in 1987 and lived in Syria before he came to Russia in 2015. 8.  The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. 9.  On 23 March 2016 the applicant was arrested for violation of migration rules. On the same day the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Izhevsk (""the district court"") imposed an administrative fine on the applicant and ordered his administrative removal and detention until his removal. 10.  On 5 April 2016 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya excluded the removal order from the administrative penalty imposed on him by the district court. 11.  On 2 June 2016 the applicant was released. 12.  On 3 June 2016 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya re‑opened the applicant's case at the request of the migration official and sent it for re-examination to the district court. 13.  On 16 June 2016 the district court reviewed the administrative removal order of 23 March 2016 and confirmed its validity. The applicant was detained on the same day. On 12 September 2016 the judgment of 16 June 2016 was upheld by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya. On 7 February 2017 the applicant filed a cassation appeal against these three decisions at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. 14.  On 15 July, 7 November and 19 December 2016 and 27 January, 2 March and 10 April 2017 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Izhevsk allowed an application lodged by the bailiff for the postponement of the enforcement of the order of administrative removal by one month owing to the application of an interim measure by the Court on 17 June 2016. The district court granted the bailiff's request having relied on Article 31.5 of the Code of Administrative Offences ((""the CAO""), see paragraph 21 below). In these proceedings the applicant's lawyer also argued that there was a lack of grounds for the applicant's detention and requested that the enforcement proceedings be terminated and that the applicant be released. However, the district court dismissed her arguments, having concluded that,
""the grounds for the applicant's detention had already been established by the court in the removal proceedings and the discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings in the circumstances of [the applicant's] case is not provided for by Article 31.7 of the CAO"" (see paragraph 22 below).
All these decisions, except the one of 15 July 2016 (no appeal was brought), were upheld by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya. 15.  On 17 May 2017 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (""the Supreme Court"") examined the cassation appeal complaint of the applicant and reviewed the judgments issued in respect of his removal (see paragraph 13 above). The Supreme Court confirmed the judgments but discontinued the enforcement of administrative penalty in the form of the removal imposed on the applicant on 23 March 2016. The Supreme Court found that the applicant might be exposed to a risk of torture or ill-treatment in Syria in the event of his return there. On 2 June 2017 the applicant was released (after the decision entered into force). 16.  On 11 May 2016 the applicant's request for refugee status was dismissed. According to the applicant, he did not appeal against this decision because the migration authorities had convinced the applicant that ""his application for temporary asylum would be granted"". 17.  On 4 July 2016 the applicant's request for temporary asylum was dismissed. 18.  On 25 November 2016 a second request lodged by the applicant for temporary asylum was denied by the migration authorities and the applicant did not lodge a complaint against this refusal. 19.  According to the information provided by the applicant's lawyer on 9 November 2017, while the proceedings before the Court were ongoing, the applicant left Russia of his own volition on 2 August 2017 and had settled in Sweden.

Explanation: The application of Article 5 to the fact pattern does not exhibit ambiguity regarding the right to liberty and security. The article clearly states the conditions under which a person can be lawfully detained, which includes ""the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorized entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition"" (5(f)). The applicant was detained and faced removal due to violation of migration rules, aligning with the provision. Moreover, the procedural aspects involving court decisions, appeals, and the ultimate release of the applicant upon determination of potential risk in his home country are within the framework allowed for under Article 5, particularly the right to a speedy judicial decision on the lawfulness of detention (4) and protection from being sent back to a country where he may face harm, following an enforced right to compensation for wrongful arrest or detention (5).

Right to an effective remedy 

Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Chisinau. 5.  At the material time, the applicant was a student and was undertaking an unpaid internship at a law firm. 6.  On 23 October 2008 criminal proceedings were initiated against T., a lawyer with whom the applicant worked, on charges of trading in influence. In particular, T. was accused of receiving 10,500 euros (EUR) from D. to pass on to the judges examining a criminal case against a relative of D.'s in order to obtain his acquittal or a more lenient sentence. The applicant had no procedural standing in those proceedings. 7.  On 30 October 2008 the police lodged with an investigating judge a request for a warrant to search the applicant's apartment. The request was granted; the decision to issue the warrant read as follows:
""The criminal investigation against T. was initiated on 23 October 2008 ... In the course of the investigation it has been established that from March until September 2008, T. extorted and received from D. in several instalments the amount of EUR 10,500, [to be given to] the judges who examined D.'s relative's case, in order to obtain his acquittal or a more lenient sentence.
On 24 October 2008 T. was caught in flagrante receiving 3,800 US dollars (USD) from D., allegedly for influencing the prosecutor not to appeal against the [subsequent] judgment [acquitting the accused].
The evidence in the file and the material obtained through the operational investigation allow the well-founded assumption that at [the applicant's] home, situated at [address], can be found EUR 10,500 received from D. and relevant documents,
Decides
To order a search of [the applicant's] residence, situated at [address], with the aim of finding and seizing EUR 10,500 received from D. and documents concerning the criminal case."" 8.  On the same day, a prosecutor lodged a request with the Buiucani District Court for a warrant to be issued for the search of the applicant's apartment. His request took the form of a verbatim copy of the police decision. Also on the same day the Buiucani district investigating judge issued a decision authorising the search. The decision read as follows:
""The present criminal proceedings were initiated on 23 October 2008 ... against T.
After hearing the prosecutor and examining the material, and taking in consideration the fact that that material had been obtained in [a manner] in compliance with the law, the court finds that the request for the authorisation of the search is well founded and should be upheld.
On the basis of Articles 41, 125, 301, 305 and 306 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court:
... 9.  On 10 December 2008 the police searched the applicant's apartment in the presence of her elderly mother [but not the applicant]. They did not find anything. 10.  On 21 August 2009 the applicant lodged a request for access to the evidence which had been presented to the judge to justify the search. On 3 September 2009 the Buiucani district investigating judge replied that the case file was held at the [premises of] the investigating authority and that access could only be granted pursuant to the law. 11.

Right to respect for private and family life 

1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 

2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Adıyaman. 5.  On 17 October 1999 the applicant sat an examination in order to become a public servant. She was successful in the examination and on 27 June 2000 she was notified by the State Personnel Department attached to the Prime Minister's office that she had been appointed to the post of security officer in the Kilis branch of TEDAŞ, the state-run Electricity Company. 6.  On 4 September 2000 the Kilis branch of TEDAŞ informed the applicant that she would not be appointed to a post in that office as she did not fulfil the requirements of ""being a man"" and ""having completed military service"". 7.  On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an action against TEDAŞ with the Ankara Administrative Court requesting the annulment of the decision of the Kilis branch of TEDAŞ. In her deposition, the applicant noted that being a man was not a requirement for appointment to the post in question and that she fulfilled all the requirements for that post. 8.  On an unspecified date the general directorate of TEDAŞ submitted to the administrative court that one of the requirements for the post in question had been declared by the State Personnel Department as ""having completed military service"" and that therefore only men could be appointed to the post. The applicant, being a woman, could therefore not be recruited as a security officer. 9.  On 28 November 2001 the Ankara Administrative Court annulled the decision of the Kilis branch of TEDAŞ. The court held that the requirement of ""having completed military service"" should be considered to apply only to male candidates and that there had been no restriction on women working as security officers in TEDAŞ. 10.  On 30 January 2002 TEDAŞ lodged an appeal against the judgment of 28 November 2001. 11.  On 1 April 2003 the applicant was recruited by TEDAŞ. 12.  On 21 October 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court, holding that the requirement regarding military service demonstrated that the post in question was reserved for male candidates. The high court therefore found that the administration's decision had been in accordance with the law. 13.  On 19 March 2004 the applicant was dismissed from her post. 14.  On 30 December 2004 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's case, taking into consideration the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court. 15.  On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the judgment of 30 December 2004. 16.  On 12 July 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court's judgment was notified to the applicant.

Statute: Protocol 1 Article 1 

Protection of property 

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. 

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Lipetsk. 6.  On 18 September 2007 the applicant signed a private contract for the purchase of a flat in Lipetsk. The seller was Ms E.M.T., acting on behalf of herself and her daughter Maria, a minor. The contract stipulated that the property was not ""mortgaged, encumbered by any claims of third parties, disputed or charged"". 7.  The flat in question had been allocated as social housing to Ms E.M.T. and her husband, Mr V.A.V., in 1979. They had lived there with their four children: Yelena, Mikhail, Dmitriy and Maria. Mikhail and Dmitriy were given long prison sentences in 1998 and 2004 respectively and were still serving them at the material time. Yelena moved out in 1997 to continue her studies in Dagestan. In 2006, Ms E.M.T and Maria became the sole owners of the property by way of privatisation, while Mr V.A.V., Mikhail, Dmitry and Yelena declined in writing to exercise their right to obtain their shares of the privatised flat. 8.  As the seller Ms E.M.T. delayed submitting the contract for State registration, the applicant sought a court order upholding her full title to the property. The seller Ms E.M.T. brought a counterclaim. She submitted that she was unable to move out because the purchase of the new flat for herself and her daughter Maria had not yet been finalised. However, after Ms E.M.T. failed to appear in court, on 2 April 2008 the Oktyabrskiy District Court in Lipetsk struck out the counterclaim and granted the applicant relief in the form of an order compelling State registration of her full title to the property. On 12 November 2008 the title was registered. 9.  The applicant then sued the former owner Ms E.M.T. and members of her family, seeking termination of their right to use the flat, annulment of the registration of their residence at that address, and their eviction. 10.  On 7 April 2009 the Oktyabrskiy District Court allowed her claim in part. It ordered the eviction of Ms E.M.T. and Maria, as they were no longer owners of the property, but dismissed the claim in respect of Yelena, Mikhail and Dmitriy on the following grounds:
""According to the parties, the contested property contains personal belongings and chattels of the defendants [Mikhail, Dmitriy and Yelena]; it appears from their written statements that, in declining their shares of the contested property during its privatisation, they did not intend to stop using the flat. Since there was no arrangement between the owner of the contested property and the defendants regarding the discontinuation of the right to use the property, the court considers that [Mikhail, Dmitriy and Yelena] had a right of use over the flat which was identical [in its scope] to that of the owner; accordingly, there are no legal grounds for allowing [the applicant's] claim to declare their right of use over the flat terminated.
A change in ownership of the contested property cannot serve as an independent ground for terminating [their] right to use the flat ...
The plaintiff's argument to the effect that [Mikhail, Dmitriy and Yelena] do not actually live in the contested property cannot serve as an independent ground for terminating [their] right of use over the flat ...
Since the defendants' right of use over the flat is not terminated, there are no grounds for ordering their eviction ..."" 11.  On 27 May 2009 the Lipetsk Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal, endorsing the District Court's judgment.

Explanation: In this scenario, there is a clear path of legal interpretation and application concerning property rights and the conditions under which those rights can be transferred or altered. The court's decisions centered around the factual circumstances of ownership, use rights, and the legal procedures for transferring property and evicting occupants, all within the framework provided by the law regarding property rights. The legal framework allows for the peaceful enjoyment of one's possessions unless deprivation is for public interest and follows law and general principles of international law, none of which directly apply in this private dispute.

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicants were born in 1954, 1952, 1964, 1926, 1952, 1960 and 1956 respectively and live in Donetsk. 6.  From the beginning of April 2014 armed groups started to seize official buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and announced the creation of self-proclaimed entities known as the ""Donetsk People's Republic"" and ""Luhansk People's Republic"" (the ""DPR"" and ""LPR""). 7.  In response, on 14 April 2014 the Government, who consider the armed groups to be terrorist organisations, authorised the use of force against them in the legal form of an ""anti-terrorist operation"". 8.  In June 2014 the armed groups started to seize offices of the National Bank of Ukraine and other regional financial institutions in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 9.  On 24 July 2014 the Ukrainian postal service Ukrposhta suspended its operations on the territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were outside the control of the Government, because of frequent attacks on its vehicles and employees by armed groups. 10.  On 6 August 2014 the National Bank of Ukraine suspended all financial transactions on the territories outside the control of the Government (see paragraph 20 below). 11.  Government forces recaptured some territories in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but certain parts of the regions have remained outside the Government's control since that time. One part of the Donetsk region not under the Government's control is the city of Donetsk. 12.  On 2 September 2014, following changes in the law, jurisdiction of the courts in the non-controlled areas was transferred to the relevant courts in the neighbouring regions on the territory controlled by the Government (see paragraphs 34 to 36 below). 13.  On 11 November 2014 all social benefit payments in the settlements of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were outside the control of the Government were suspended (see paragraph 26 below) 14.  In December 2014 the Donetsk Regional Administrative Court and the Donetsk Regional Administrative Court of Appeal were relocated to the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, territory controlled by the Government (see paragraphs 37 and 38 below). 15.  The applicants were registered as recipients of social benefits with different departments of the Pension Fund of Ukraine in Donetsk. Some applicants had been receiving their social benefits until 30 June 2014, others until 31 August 2014. 16.  On 16 June 2015 the first and second applicants registered themselves with the Labour and Social Security Department of the Krasnoarmiysk District of the Donetsk region (currently the city of Pokrovsk), controlled by the Government. On the same day their social benefits was reinstated, including social benefits due to them for the period 1 July 2014 to 16 June 2015. 17.  The sixth applicant was registered with the Labour and Social Security Department of the Obolonskiy District in Kyiv on 9 September 2015. However, she did not apply for reinstatement of her social benefits. 18.  The other applicants did not apply to the relevant social authorities on the territory controlled by the Government for reinstatement of their social benefits. 19.  According to the Government, the sixth and seventh applicants travelled from Donetsk to the territory controlled by the Government after their social benefits had been suspended. The Government provided a certificate from the State Customs Office stating that the sixth and seventh applicants had entered the territory controlled by the Government on 31 October 2015, through an authorised checkpoint near the frontline between Ukrainian forces and ""DPR"" armed groups in the town of Zaitseve.

Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice. 

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law. 

3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: 
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; 
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; 
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;

(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.
Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1960 and lives in Čurug. 5.  On 2 August 2002 the applicant and one of his colleagues (hereinafter ""the plaintiffs"") instituted civil proceedings against their employer seeking payment of salary arrears and other employment-related benefits. 6.  On 8 February 2013, after two remittals the First Instance Court in Novi Sad, specifically its Detached Section in Bečej, ruled partly in favour of the plaintiffs, ordering their employer to pay each of them specified sums in respect of salary arrears. The remainder of their claims was rejected. 7.  On 15 April 2013 the Court of Appeal in Novi Sad reversed a part of the above judgment, while upholding the remainder. This judgment was served on the plaintiffs on 6 June 2013. 8.  On 29 January 2014 the Supreme Court dismissed the plaintiffs' appeal on points of law as the value of their respective claims was below the statutory threshold allowing for this remedy. 9.  On 9 April 2013 the plaintiffs lodged the constitutional appeal, complaining of a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time in the impugned proceedings. By its decision of 9 December 2015, the Constitutional Court found a violation of their right to a hearing within a reasonable time and awarded each of them EUR 800 in respect of the non‑pecuniary damage suffered.

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Oradea. 6.  On 29 November 2000 the prosecutor's office attached to the Bihor County Court (""the prosecutor's office"") discontinued the criminal proceedings which it had opened against the applicant on 24 November 2000 for bribe taking. 7.  On 10 January 2001 the prosecutor's office attached to the Bihor Court of Appeal quashed the above-mentioned decision of its own motion and ordered that the proceedings against the applicant be reopened. 8.  On 5 February and 11 June 2001, respectively, the prosecutor's office reopened the criminal proceedings against the applicant for bribe taking and opened criminal proceedings against him for abuse of office. 9.  On 29 July 2002 the State Agency for Capitalisation of Banking Assets (Autoritate Pentru Valorificarea Activelor Bancare – ""AVAB"") joined the criminal proceedings against the applicant as a civil party. It sought the recovery of 27,863,805,105 Romanian lei (ROL) (approximately 1,758,753 US dollars (USD)), the damage that it had allegedly incurred as a result of the applicant's abuse of office. 10. On 16 August 2002 the prosecutor's office ordered the seizure of the applicant's movable and immovable assets up to the value of the damage allegedly incurred by AVAB. The order was enforced by the Bihor Police Department on 19 December 2002 by seizing part of the immovable properties owned jointly by the applicant and his wife, in particular four plots of intra muros agricultural land, a home and annexes. 11.  On 29 August 2002 the prosecutor's office indicted the applicant for bribe taking and for abuse of office and sent his case for trial. 12.  Between 7 October 2002 and 6 February 2006 the Bihor County Court (""the County Court"") adjourned the proceedings twenty-four times to allow the parties to prepare their defence, for the court to summon the parties and the witnesses, to hear evidence, and for deliberations. Also, at a hearing on 10 February 2003, the court dismissed the applicant's challenge against the order of 16 August 2002 on the grounds that the measure was temporary and had been enforced correctly. This decision was upheld by the Oradea Court of Appeal (""the Court of Appeal"") on 11 March 2003 following an appeal by the applicant. 13.  On 13 February 2006 the County Court examined the applicant's case on the merits and acquitted him of abuse of office. However, it held that the applicant had to pay AVAB the damages it claimed because AVAB had suffered damage as a result of his actions. Consequently, the court maintained the measure imposed on the applicant's assets. It also convicted the applicant of bribe taking and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment, suspended. 14.  The applicant appealed against the judgment to the Court of Appeal. 15.  Between 20 June and 11 July 2006 the Court of Appeal adjourned the proceedings twice to allow the parties to prepare their cases. On 19 September 2006 the court quashed the judgment of 13 February 2006 and referred the case back to the first-instance court for re-examination on procedural grounds. 16.  Between 30 November 2006 and 1 April 2010 the County Court adjourned the proceedings thirty-two times to allow the parties to prepare their defence, for the court-assigned expert to produce two expert reports, and for the court to summon the parties and the witnesses, to hear evidence, for deliberations, and to allow the judges to exercise their right to strike. Also, at a hearing on 4 June 2007 the court adjourned the examination of the applicant's request for the measure imposed on his assets to be lifted pending the court's determination of the case. 17.  On 8 April 2010 the County Court examined the applicant's case on the merits, acquitted him of abuse of office and dismissed AVAB's civil claim. Consequently, it lifted the seizure measure from his assets. The court convicted the applicant, however, of receiving bribes and gave him a suspended sentence of three years' imprisonment. 18.  The applicant and AVAB appealed against the judgment to the Court of Appeal. 19.  Between 21 September and 16 November 2010 the Court of Appeal adjourned the proceedings twice to allow the parties to prepare their cases, to summon them, and for the court to deliberate. On 23 November 2010 the court dismissed the appeals of the parties and upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. 20.  The applicant and AVAB appealed on points of fact and law against the judgment to the High Court of Cassation and Justice (""the Court of Cassation""). 21.  Between 23 February and 20 April 2011 the Court of Cassation adjourned the proceedings once to allow the applicant to prepare his case. 22.  By a final judgment of 4 May 2011 the Court of Cassation allowed the applicant's appeal on points of fact and law in part. It held that he was guilty of bribe taking, but his criminal liability for that offence had become time-barred. The court upheld the remaining parts of the judgments delivered by the lower courts. 23.  On 4 March 2012, once the applicant had submitted certified copies of all the courts' judgments, the Bihor Land and Immovable Property Register removed the annotation concerning the seizure measure imposed on his immovable property from the above-mentioned register, which had prevented him from freely disposing of it.

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Moscow. 6.  The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7.  On 24 November 2006 the applicant, the owner and CEO of a large dairy producer, was charged with large-scale fraud and money laundering and summoned for questioning. He did not show up for a few initial interviews and the investigator put his name on the list of fugitives from justice. 8.  On 26 January 2007 the investigator, acting on the information that the applicant had fled abroad, asked the Ostankinskiy District Court in Moscow for a detention order. 9.  The detention hearing was fixed for 1 February 2007. The applicant's lawyers had been notified of the date and time of the hearing on the previous day but did not show up and asked the investigator to postpone the examination of his application because they were busy in other proceedings. The District Court appointed legal-aid counsel to represent the absent applicant, proceeded with the hearing and issued the detention order, referring to the fact of the applicant's absconding to Ukraine and from there to Hungary, the gravity of the charges against him and the risk of interference with the investigation. On 9 February 2007 the applicant's lawyers appealed. 10.  On 15 February 2007 the applicant was arrested in Moscow. 11.  On 19 March 2007 the Moscow City Court heard an appeal against the detention order. The applicant and his lawyers were present at the hearing. Considering that the risks of flight and obstruction of the investigation were sufficiently established, the City Court upheld the detention order. 12.  The applicant's detention was later extended on nine occasions. The applicant appealed against each of the detention orders, lodging statements of appeal within two to ten days of the hearing date. It took the appeal courts between twenty-six and sixty days to examine the complaints. 13.  The most recent detention order of 25 July 2008 was quashed on appeal by the Supreme Court on 2 October 2008. The Supreme Court considered that there was no evidence substantiating the risk of absconding or interfering with justice. The investigation had been pending for over two years of which the applicant had spent more than a year and a half in custody. The Supreme Court concluded that that the proceedings had been unreasonably long and ordered the applicant's release on bail. 14.  While in custody, the applicant asked the investigator to be allowed to receive visits from his mother, wife and children and also pastoral visits from two Orthodox priests, A. and S. 15.  With the investigator's consent, the applicant's mother and daughters visited him on two occasions in April and May 2007. In August and September 2007 the investigator interviewed his wife and mother as potential witnesses but they refused to testify, invoking the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination. The investigator refused the applicant's subsequent applications to see his family, stating that such visits could ""have a negative influence on the conduct of the investigation"". As to the Orthodox priests, on 29 March 2007 the investigator invoked the same ground to refuse a visit from S. On 30 August 2007 the investigator once again refused a pastoral visit, stating that the applicant should see the prison chaplain instead. 16.  Counsel for the applicant applied for a judicial review of visiting restrictions. 17.  On 24 October 2007 and 6 February 2008 the Tverskoy District Court pronounced the refusal of pastoral visits to be lawful and justified, holding that the investigator had full discretion to determine whether or not such visits ran counter to the interests of the investigation. On 18 June 2008 the City Court upheld the latter decision on appeal, holding that a restriction on religious rights was an inherent consequence of the pre-trial detention. 18.  As regards family visits, on 30 October 2007 the Tverskoy District Court granted the applicant's complaint in part, finding as follows:
(a)  restrictions on visits from the applicant's wife and mother in the period after the investigator had interviewed them as witnesses in the criminal proceedings had been lawful and within the discretion of the investigator;
(b)  restrictions on visits from the wife and mother in the preceding period had not been justified but no relief could be afforded to the applicant because they had already been granted the status of witnesses and the investigator might wish to interview them again at some point in time;
(c)  restrictions on visits from the applicant's children were not justified and the investigator had an obligation to remedy a breach of the applicant's rights. 19.  On 10 December 2007 the applicant's representative before the Court, Ms Kostromina, asked the director of the remand prison to allow her to see the applicant and provided credentials confirming her status. Her application was referred to the investigator. 20.  On 24 January 2008 Ms Kostromina lodged a complaint with the Preobrazhenskiy District Court claiming that the prison director should have authorised her visit without any restrictions, on the basis of Article 34 of the Convention guaranteeing unhindered access of an applicant to his representative. 21.  On 15 February 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint, finding that Ms Kostromina was not the applicant's counsel in the domestic criminal proceedings and could not therefore visit him. On 6 May 2008 the Moscow City Court upheld that decision on appeal.

The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Moscow. 6.  The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7.  On 24 November 2006 the applicant, the owner and CEO of a large dairy producer, was charged with large-scale fraud and money laundering and summoned for questioning. He did not show up for a few initial interviews and the investigator put his name on the list of fugitives from justice. 8.  On 26 January 2007 the investigator, acting on the information that the applicant had fled abroad, asked the Ostankinskiy District Court in Moscow for a detention order. 9.  The detention hearing was fixed for 1 February 2007. The applicant's lawyers had been notified of the date and time of the hearing on the previous day but did not show up and asked the investigator to postpone the examination of his application because they were busy in other proceedings. The District Court appointed legal-aid counsel to represent the absent applicant, proceeded with the hearing and issued the detention order, referring to the fact of the applicant's absconding to Ukraine and from there to Hungary, the gravity of the charges against him and the risk of interference with the investigation. On 9 February 2007 the applicant's lawyers appealed. 10.  On 15 February 2007 the applicant was arrested in Moscow. 11.  On 19 March 2007 the Moscow City Court heard an appeal against the detention order. The applicant and his lawyers were present at the hearing. Considering that the risks of flight and obstruction of the investigation were sufficiently established, the City Court upheld the detention order. 12.  The applicant's detention was later extended on nine occasions. The applicant appealed against each of the detention orders, lodging statements of appeal within two to ten days of the hearing date. It took the appeal courts between twenty-six and sixty days to examine the complaints. 13.  The most recent detention order of 25 July 2008 was quashed on appeal by the Supreme Court on 2 October 2008. The Supreme Court considered that there was no evidence substantiating the risk of absconding or interfering with justice. The investigation had been pending for over two years of which the applicant had spent more than a year and a half in custody. The Supreme Court concluded that that the proceedings had been unreasonably long and ordered the applicant's release on bail. 14.  While in custody, the applicant asked the investigator to be allowed to receive visits from his mother, wife and children and also pastoral visits from two Orthodox priests, A. and S. 15.  With the investigator's consent, the applicant's mother and daughters visited him on two occasions in April and May 2007. In August and September 2007 the investigator interviewed his wife and mother as potential witnesses but they refused to testify, invoking the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination. The investigator refused the applicant's subsequent applications to see his family, stating that such visits could ""have a negative influence on the conduct of the investigation"". As to the Orthodox priests, on 29 March 2007 the investigator invoked the same ground to refuse a visit from S. On 30 August 2007 the investigator once again refused a pastoral visit, stating that the applicant should see the prison chaplain instead. 16.  Counsel for the applicant applied for a judicial review of visiting restrictions. 17.  On 24 October 2007 and 6 February 2008 the Tverskoy District Court pronounced the refusal of pastoral visits to be lawful and justified, holding that the investigator had full discretion to determine whether or not such visits ran counter to the interests of the investigation.

Explanation: The fact pattern presents several instances where the application of the statute related to the right to liberty and security could be considered legally ambiguous. Specifically, the prolonged detention period, the refusal of family and pastoral visits under the pretext of investigation needs, and the restrictions placed on the applicant's access to legal representation challenge the provisions stipulated in Article 5 of the statute. The ambiguity arises in determining whether the measures taken by the authorities (prolonged detention, visitation restrictions, and delays in reviewing detention appeals) align with or contravene the conditions under which liberty may be deprived, particularly concerning the requirements for lawful detention, prompt information about charges, the right to be brought before a judge promptly, and the entitlement to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial.

Fact pattern: 5.  The first applicant was born in 1972 and is detained in Vilnius. The second applicant was born in 1982 and is detained in Pravieniškės. 6.  The first applicant has been detained in Lukiškės Remand Prison since 17 March 2008. 7.  On 27 July 2012 he lodged a civil claim against the State, alleging that he was being detained in overcrowded and unsanitary cells. He claimed 74,690 Lithuanian litai (LTL – approximately 21,630 euros (EUR)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 8.  On 8 November 2012 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court allowed in part the applicant's claim. It firstly held that the time‑limit for claiming damages was three years after the damage arose, and accordingly dismissed the part of the applicant's claim concerning the period before 27 July 2009 as time‑barred. The court then examined various documents provided by the prison authorities and found that, during the remaining period, for about one year and seven months the size of the personal space afforded to the applicant had not complied with the domestic requirements (until 11 May 2010 the minimum personal space in prison cells stipulated by domestic law was 5 sq. m, and from 11 May 2010 it was 3.6 sq. m). 9.  The court also found, on the basis of reports submitted by domestic public healthcare authorities, that the temperature and the amount of natural light in some of the cells in which the applicant had been detained had not complied with domestic hygiene norms. However, it dismissed as unproved the applicant's allegations that the cells had been dilapidated and that there had been parasites and rodents. Furthermore, the court considered that the applicant had not proved that his health had deteriorated as a result of the conditions of his detention. 10.  The applicant was awarded LTL 1,500 (approximately EUR 434) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 11.  The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, but on 20 May 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed his appeal and upheld the lower court's decision in its entirety. 12.  The second applicant was detained in Vilnius Correctional Facility from 8 June 2012 to 5 February 2016. 13.  On 4 October 2013 he lodged a civil claim against the State, alleging that he was being detained in overcrowded dormitory‑type rooms. He claimed LTL 11,000 (approximately EUR 3,200) in respect of non‑pecuniary damage. 14.  On 12 March 2014 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court allowed in part the applicant's claim. The court found that for seventy‑nine days the applicant had had 2.9 sq. m of personal space, in breach of the domestic requirement of 3.1 sq. m applicable to dormitory‑type rooms. It also found that for eighteen days, when the applicant had been kept under stricter disciplinary regime, he had had 3.34 sq. m of personal space, in breach of the domestic requirement of 3.6 sq. m applicable to such cells. 15.  However, the court noted that the applicant had been allowed to move freely around the correctional facility during the day, except when he had been serving disciplinary penalties, and that the material conditions of his detention had been appropriate. It also considered that the applicant had not proved that his health had deteriorated as a result of the conditions of his detention. The court therefore dismissed the applicant's claim for non‑pecuniary damages. 16.  The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision and on 15 May 2015 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld in part his appeal. It found that, according to the applicant's submissions which the administration of the correctional facility had failed to refute, for 274 days he had had between 2.33 and 3.04 sq. m of personal space, in breach of the relevant domestic requirements. The court considered that, despite the fact that the applicant had been allowed to move freely during the day and that the material conditions of detention had been appropriate, there were grounds to award him non-pecuniary damages. The applicant was awarded EUR 130.

Fact pattern: 5.  Following judicial proceedings which ended with a final judgment of the Bălţi Court of Appeal of 8 December 2009, the applicant company obtained a final ruling obliging the Cadastral Authority to register immovable property privatised by it in 1999 and in 2004 in its name. 6.  On an unspecified date the defendant in the proceedings lodged a request for a review of the judgment of 8 December 2009, seeking its annulment on the grounds that in a technical report dated 25 May 2009 it had been stated that the immovable property in question did not qualify as immovable property (""the review request""). 7.  On 24 August 2010 the Bălţi Court of Appeal dismissed the review request on the grounds that the information contained in the technical report of 25 May 2009 did not qualify as new and relevant information which could not have been obtained before the delivery of the final judgment in the case. 8.  On 22 December 2010 the Supreme Court quashed the above judgment and ordered a re-examination of the review request. 9.  On 16 November 2011 the Chişinău Court of Appeal re-examined the review request and allowed it. The court relied on grounds other than those relied upon by the defendant in framing the request. In particular, the court relied on a Government decision from 2005, in accordance with which the disputed goods had been transferred to the defendant's control. The court quashed the final judgment of 8 December 2009 and ordered a fresh examination of the case. 10.  On 16 August 2012, after examining the merits of the case, the Edineţ District Court again found in favour of the applicant company and required the Cadastral Authority to register some of the immovable property privatised by the applicant company in 1999 and in 2004 in its name. The Cadastral Authority challenged that judgment by lodging an appeal and the proceedings are still pending.

Explanation: The fact pattern describes a legal dispute regarding the registration of immovable property privatised by the applicant company, which does not directly involve deprivation of property but rather a legal battle over the recognition of property rights. The dispute and subsequent judicial review revolve around procedural matters and the interpretation of property qualifications and governmental decisions, not an arbitrary or unjust deprivation of property without public interest or without following the law. Therefore, there's no inherent legal ambiguity in applying the statute (Protocol 1 Article 1) to this fact pattern, as the core issue lies in the execution and interpretation of property law and administrative procedures rather than a direct challenge to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions or deprivation of property rights as outlined by the statute.",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,0,There is no deprivation of property in the fact pattern.,FALSE,incorrect,N/A,FALSE

Fact pattern: 5.  The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Chișinău. 6.  At the time of the events the applicant was the owner of a company, incorporated in Moldova, which ran an erotic video-chat business in Chișinău. It employed young female models who provided erotic shows via webcam to customers outside Moldova in exchange for payment. 7.  On 3 March 2015 the applicant was arrested and accused of pimping (proxenetism). 8.  On 7 March 2015, at the request of a public prosecutor, the Centru District Court ordered that the applicant be remanded in custody for a period of thirty days. The applicant appealed against the order and argued that his detention had not been based on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence. He submitted that he could not be accused of pimping, in that the female models employed by him had not been engaged in prostitution. He argued that the prosecutor and the court which had ordered his detention had applied an extensive interpretation of the provisions of the Criminal Code concerning the offence of pimping. He also argued that the existing case-law of the domestic courts did not contain anything which would enable erotic video-chat activity to be assimilated with prostitution and pimping. The applicant also contended that there were no relevant and sufficient reasons for remanding him in custody. 9.  On 16 March 2015 the Chișinău Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal and held that there had been grounds to believe that he might abscond or interfere with the investigation. The court did not respond to the applicant's argument about a lack of reasonable suspicion and the allegation of extensive interpretation of the criminal law. 10.  On 31 March 2015 the Centru District Court upheld a request by the Public Prosecutor and prolonged the applicant's detention for another thirty days. The applicant appealed on the same grounds as on the first occasion. However, his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 7 April 2015. 11.  On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a habeas corpus request, which was upheld by the Centru District Court on 27 April 2015; the applicant was released from detention. 12.  During the proceedings the applicant explained that, prior to starting the video-chat business, he had consulted a lawyer to make sure that the activity was legal in Moldova, and he had been assured that it was not illegal. He also submitted that he had seen numerous similar businesses in Chișinău, which had strengthened his belief that the activity was not unlawful. 13.  On 30 December 2016 the Centru District Court found the applicant guilty as charged but ordered that the criminal proceedings against him be terminated on the basis of an amnesty law. One of the conditions for applying the amnesty law was for the applicant to admit his guilt and express remorse. The applicant did not appeal against this decision. 14.  In deciding the case, the court sought an opinion from the State Agency for the Protection of Morality as to whether the acts committed by the female models employed by the applicant could be qualified as prostitution and, thus, whether the applicant's activity could be qualified as pimping. The opinion of 21 October 2015, which was the key element in convicting the applicant and was subsequently used in other similar cases, stated that the actions of the female models employed by the applicant could be considered acts of prostitution, in that their clients could obtain sexual gratification as a result of the models' performance and because the models were paid for those acts. Thus, the fact that the applicant obtained revenue from the above activity could be considered pimping.

Explanation: The fact pattern describes a situation where applicants were awarded pecuniary damages or specific actions in their favor by domestic courts against debtor companies, which were state or municipal unitary enterprises. These awards came as a result of lawful court proceedings. However, some of these debtor companies entered insolvency proceedings and were subsequently liquidated, potentially affecting the ability of the applicants to collect their awarded damages or enforce the court-ordered actions.

There is no legal ambiguity in applying the statute of ""Protection of property"" to the described fact pattern for the following reasons:

1. The statute primarily protects the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions, but it also expressly allows for deprivation of possessions in the public interest under laws necessary to control the use of property, secure the payment of taxes, or other contributions or penalties.
2. The insolvency and liquidation of debtor companies, while unfortunate for creditors including the applicants, are legal processes aimed at managing companies that are unable to pay their debts. These processes are not fundamentally at odds with the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of possessions, especially because they are part of the legal framework designed to address situations where a company can no longer meet its financial obligations.
3. The statute acknowledges the right of a State to enforce laws deemed necessary to control the use of property in accordance with general interest, which can include laws governing insolvency and liquidation processes.
4. The fact that the applicants might be unable to recover their awarded damages or see the court-ordered actions carried out due to the insolvency and liquidation of the debtor companies does not in itself indicate a violation of the statute. It reflects the reality that insolvency proceedings can impair the ability of creditors to collect debts, a phenomenon that is implicitly recognized as a possibility within the legal framework described by the statute.

Fact pattern: 4.  The applicant was born in 1968 and has been serving a prison sentence in Lukiškės Remand Prison since 16 January 2002. 5.  On 16 May 2014 the applicant lodged a civil claim against the State, alleging that he was being detained in overcrowded and unsanitary cells. He also complained that toilets were not properly partitioned from the rest of the cells and thus the prison staff could see him use the toilet. He submitted that his health had deteriorated as a result of the inappropriate conditions of his detention and claimed 450,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 130,300 euros (EUR)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 6.  On 19 January 2015 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court allowed the applicant's claim in part. It firstly held that the time-limit for claiming damages was three years after the damage arose, and accordingly dismissed the part of the applicant's claim concerning the period before 16 May 2011 as time-barred. On the basis of documents provided by the prison administration, the court found that from 16 May 2011 to 15 May 2014 the applicant had spent 1,082 days in Lukiškės Remand Prison. During that period, for thirteen days and one afternoon he had had 3.24 sq. m of personal space and on one afternoon he had had 2.65 sq. m of personal space, in breach of the domestic standard of 3.6 sq. m. For the remaining time the personal space available to him was found to be in compliance with the requirement of 3.6 sq. m. 7.  The court also quoted the report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (""the CPT"") on its visit to Lithuania in 2012. According to that report, nearly all the inmates in Lukiškės Remand Prison were confined to their cells for twenty-three hours per day, with no out-of-cell activities other than outdoor exercise lasting one hour in small and dilapidated yards (see paragraph 13 below). The court noted that the prison administration had not provided any evidence that the situation in the prison had changed. 8.  Furthermore, the court ruled that toilets had not been partitioned from the rest of the cells in the manner required by relevant domestic regulations. It stated that, in accordance with accepted social norms, inability to use the toilet in private was degrading and humiliating to the individual. 9.  The court considered that the applicant had not proved that his health had deteriorated as a result of the conditions of his detention. It awarded the applicant EUR 80 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, taking into account the ""scope, intensity and duration"" of the violation of his rights and the economic conditions in the country. 10.  The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, arguing that the first-instance court had erred by dismissing part of his claim as time-barred, that the conditions in Lukiškės Remand Prison had not improved and that his health had deteriorated because of them. On 10 November 2015 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the first-instance court's decision in its entirety. The applicant's rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention were violated.

Explanation: While the applicant has a right to effective remedy, the court awarded some remedies and provided reasonable explanations for other lack of remedy such as time barring. It depends on what the statute means by ""effective"" remedy.

Statute: Protocol 1 Article 1 

Protection of property 

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. 

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.
Fact pattern: 5.  The first and third applicants were born in 1941, the second applicant was born in 1974, and the fourth applicant was born in 1967. The first, second and third applicants live in Kazanlak and the fourth applicant lives in Sofia. 6.  Ms Maria Kopankova and her grandson, the fourth applicant (son of the first applicant) co-owned a house with a garden in Kazanlak. At the time Ms Maria Kopankova lived in the house with her two sons, the first applicant and Mr Kancho Kopankov, and their families, which included the remaining applicants (the second and third applicants are Mr Kancho Kopankov's wife and son). 7.  By a decision of the town mayor of 18 July 1988 the property was expropriated under the Territorial and Urban Planning Act with a view to constructing a residential building. The decision stated that each of the two owners (Ms Maria Kopankova and the fourth applicant) were to be compensated with a flat in a building which the municipality planned to construct. 8.  After the expropriation the municipal authorities opened a blocked housing savings account with the State Savings Bank in the name of Ms Maria Kopankova and the fourth applicant and transferred to it 13,420 old Bulgarian levs (BGL) – the equivalent of the expropriated property's value as assessed at the time. 9.  In 1989 Ms Maria Kopankova and the applicants were moved out of the expropriated property and the house was pulled down. Construction work started on the plot of land and the foundations of a future building were laid. However, the site was soon after that abandoned. 10.  Throughout the years that followed Ms Maria Kopankova and the applicants petitioned on many occasions the municipal authorities to provide them with the compensation due, but to no avail. The mayor never took a decision specifying the exact future flats to be offered in compensation (see paragraph 20 below). 11.  In 1998 Ms Maria Kopankova passed away and was succeeded by her sons, the first applicant and Mr Kancho Kopankov. The latter passed away in 2011 and was succeeded by the second and third applicants. 12.  On 16 February 2009 the applicants and Mr Kancho Kopankov made a request to the mayor under section 9(2) of the transitional provisions of the Territorial Planning Act of 2001 (hereinafter ""section 9(2)"") for the revocation of the expropriation order of 18 July 1988. As no response followed, they applied for judicial review of the mayor's tacit refusal. 13.  The Stara Zagora Administrative Court (hereinafter ""the Administrative Court"") gave a judgment on 27 May 2010. It found, firstly, that the fourth applicant and Ms Maria Kopankova, and subsequently her heirs, had not received the compensation due to them, namely two flats. It pointed out in this connection that the transfer of money to a blocked housing savings account in their name (see paragraph 8 above) was not equivalent to the provision of compensation. The Administrative Court found further that the authorities had not ""taken possession"" of the applicants' property, within the meaning of section 9(2), because there had been no formal decision to take possession (as had been required at the time), and because in any event the construction work which had started on the plot had eventually been abandoned. Thus, the preconditions for the revocation of the 1988 expropriation under section 9(2) had been fulfilled. On that basis the Administrative Court quashed the mayor's tacit refusal and revoked the expropriation order. 14.  The judgment above was not appealed against and became final. 15.  In 2011 the applicants brought a tort action against the Kazanlak municipality under section 1 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 23 below). They claimed the value of the house and of other objects (such as trees, the pavement and outbuildings) which had stood on the plot of land and had been destroyed, but for which they had never received any compensation. The applicants also made claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 16.  In the context of the ensuing proceedings the Administrative Court, examining the case, appointed experts, who estimated the value of the house and the remaining objects at 37,868 new Bulgarian levs (BGN – the equivalent of approximately 19,370 euros (EUR)). 17.  In a decision of 26 January 2012 the Administrative Court found the applicants' claims inadmissible and refused to examine them on the merits. It reasoned that the applicants' situation had been regulated by sections 9(1) and 9(2) of the transitional provisions of the Territorial Planning Act of 2001 (see paragraph 22 below, hereinafter ""section 9(1)"" and ""section 9(2)""), and that the existence of such a special avenue of redress meant that the general tort provisions of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act did not apply. 18.  These conclusions were upheld in a final decision of 20 April 2012 of the Supreme Administrative Court, which added that since the expropriation of the applicants' property had been quashed and the expropriation proceedings completed, the municipality could not be liable for any damage stemming from these proceedings. It pointed out in addition that the applicants' claims did not fall to be examined by the civil courts, under the general rules of tort, and that the administrative courts remained competent to examine them, even though the claims were inadmissible. It thus refused to apply Article 135 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (see paragraph 25 below) and transfer the case to the civil courts, as the applicants had requested.

Explanation: There is no legal ambiguity in the application of Protocol 1 Article 1 to the fact pattern. The statute provides for the protection of property, including the requirement that any deprivation of possessions must be in the public interest and subject to legal and international principles. The fact pattern describes a situation where property was expropriated for public interest (constructing a residential building), and compensation was provided though initially in the form of a blocked housing savings account, which was later deemed not equivalent to fair compensation by the courts. The legal processes, including the final revocation of the expropriation order and the subsequent legal actions, reflect the application of the principles in Protocol 1 Article 1. The courts acknowledged the rights of the applicants and attempted to rectify the situation through legal means. The issue laid in the adequacy and form of compensation, which was addressed within the legal framework and does not present an ambiguity regarding the application of the statute to the fact pattern.",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,1,"It depends if money that is yet to be granted counts as possessions according to the statute, but that seems to be the common understanding.",FALSE,N/A,overlook,FALSE
